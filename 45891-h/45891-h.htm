<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center p1 mid">MY LORD CARDINAL'S DAUGHTER.</p>

<p class="pn p2">One remarkable circumstance among those which
specially characterised the great intellectual movement
in Italy in the sixteenth century, was the large
part taken in it by women. The writers of literary
history,—a class especially abundant to the south of
the Alps,—enumerate a surprisingly long catalogue
of ladies more or less celebrated for their works. The
list of poetesses registered by Tiraboschi as flourishing
during the first half of the sixteenth century, consists
of some forty names. And he intimates, that it might
have been made much longer, had he thought it worth
while to record every name mentioned by the chroniclers
of such matters, who preceded him. A great
many more are noticed as having been "learned" or
"skilled in polite literature."</p>

<p>Such facts constitute a very noteworthy feature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the social aspect of the period in question; and doubtless
influenced largely the tone of society and manners,
as well as the position and well–being of the sex. But
it is very questionable, whether certain theories
respecting the comparative value of modern female
education, to which all this sixteenth century galaxy
has given rise, be not founded on misconception partly
of the value of the learning possessed by these ladies,
and more still of the circumstances and appearance,
under which it presented itself to them.</p>

<p>Intellectual culture in that day meant especially,
almost exclusively, what has been since more technically
called "learning." The movement, which was
then once again stirring up the mind of the educated
classes arose mainly, as every body knows, from the
discovery and resuscitation of the literature of ancient
Greece and Rome. To be, if not a good Grecian, at
least a competent Latin scholar, was the first step
absolutely necessary in the liberal education of either
male or female. Nay, it constituted very frequently
not only the first step, but the entire course. In Italy
this was in an especial degree the case. Not only
the fashion of literature, but the general tone of the
educated mind became classical,—and pagan. And
the rapidity with which the new modes of thought
and fashion of taste spread, and,—speaking of course
with reference only to the educated classes,—popularised
themselves, is very striking. But they did so,
because they were eminently suited to the proclivity
of the minds to which they were presented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW LEARNING.</div>

<p>For this new learning came to them as an emancipation
and a licence. Such learning as had been
before in existence was dry, severe, repulsive, associated
only with ideas of discipline, sacrifice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
renunciation of the world and its pleasures—the
proper business of ascetic priests and hermits. The
new studies were the reverse of all this. Elegant,
facile, materialistic in all their tendencies and associations,
adapting themselves readily to the amusements
and passions of the young and gay, they must
be compared, if we would parallel them with aught of
modern culture, with the lighter of those accomplishments,
which are now called ornamental. The total
unchristianising of Italian society, which the rage for
classical literature very rapidly produced, was such
as strikingly to justify the modern<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> crusade against
classical culture preached by those who are anxious
to preserve such Christianity as that, which then
went down before the irruption of literary paganism.
The exquisitely organised æsthetic faculties of the
southern mind eagerly imbibed and readily assimilated
the habits of thought, generated by a religion,
whose only real object of worship was material beauty.
The extremely relaxed morality of the time was subjected
to a refining influence, but by no means checked
by a literature rich in poetical drapery for every form
of vice. And the lightest, gayest, freest portion of
society, beginning now to be awakened to a relish for
the elegances of life by increasing wealth and luxury,
found exactly what suited them in the revived literature
of the forefathers of their race; a literature which
was the product of generations uninfluenced by the
wholly irreconcilable ideas of a philosophy and religion
imposed on their descendants with very partial success
by men of differently constituted races from the east
and from the north.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>Englishmen are wont to estimate the study of the
literature of Greece and Rome in a manner very much
at variance with the ideas expressed in the above
sentences; and judging it, as of course we do, from
its results among ourselves, most justly so. It would
take us much too far afield to examine satisfactorily
why these results should have been so different in the
two cases. The most important portion of the causes
of difference would probably be found to consist in
the dissimilarity of our northern idiosyncrasies to
those of the ancient writers. In Italy, the old tree
bore its own natural fruit. With us, it was engrafted
on another stock. The southern mind became all
classical. The northern mind was modified only by
contact with the ancient literature. Perhaps also,
some weight may be allowed to the greater difficulty
of the study in our case; whence it has arisen, that
the thorough and analytical study of the dead languages,
has been deemed eminently profitable as
intellectual discipline, and as the best foundation of
general mental culture.</p>

<p>And these views of classic learning lead us to
attribute almost instinctively, as it were, a high
degree of solidity, grave scholastic laboriousness, and
respectability to the acquirements of those who possess
it. A lady well read in Greek and Latin, appears to
us to have necessarily reached an intellectual elevation
which places her above the shallowness, superficiality,
and frivolousness with which modern female education
is ordinarily reproached. And we sigh over the supposed
inferiority in this respect, of England in the
nineteenth century, to the brilliant Italy of the sixteenth.
It is true, that in the case of Vittoria
Colonna, we have seen a product of the classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
training of that day, which—<i>mutatis mutandis</i>—we
might be content to reproduce. But the instance is
wholly exceptional; and the qualities, moreover, which
we admire in Vittoria are to be traced, probably, as
far as they are independent on constitutional idiosyncrasy,
to those associations with some very remarkable
men, which taught her to use her ancient learning as
a tool, and not a final object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COUNCIL OF TRENT.</div>

<p>The subject of these pages is a less exceptional
product of Italian sixteenth century classical studies;
but by no means a less curious and suggestive
exponent of one phase of the social life and manners
of that epoch.</p>

<p>Among the grave and reverend seniors industriously
busy at Trent, in the year 1552, at their great work of
constructing a dam to stop the course of a perennial
river, may be observed one Peter Tagliavia, Archbishop
of Palermo, a silver–haired and right reverend
old man, very prudent, wise, and sagacious, we are
told, in the management of affairs of all<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> sorts.
There he is sagaciously dragging forward his bit of
stick to contribute to the formation of the great dam,
undismayed by the swift running of the stream the
while. He is much puzzled by the consideration of
the manner and style in which it will be proper for
the assembled Fathers of the Church to communicate
with heretics. For it is quite clear, on the one hand,
that <i>being</i> heretics and excommunicate, and damned
already accordingly, all propriety and Church etiquette
would require that they should be treated and addressed
as such. But, on the other hand, there is reason to
believe that their arrogance will reach the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
expecting to be treated like Christians, and that failing
such treatment, no reply will be got from them at all,
and so all proceedings be stopped <i>in limine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Very
perplexing!</p>

<p>The sagacious Archbishop insisted much on this
point, dragging up his bit of drift wood to the dam
with pertinacious industry. He was made a cardinal
in the following year for this and other merits;
partly also, because he had royal blood in his
veins,—writing himself "Tagliavia d'Aragona." He
died five years later, in 1558, still busy in damming
that terrible river, which was already changing the face
of things around him. Even Rome itself was very
unlike what he had remembered it in the good old
times, some fifty years ago or thereabouts. Ah!
Rome was worth living in and living for in those
days! Happy days! when, as His Eminence of
Bibbiena used to say, we wanted nothing but a court
with ladies. Court, with ladies, quotha!</p>

<p>And with that our Archbishop's musings on the
brave old days, when the second Julius was Pope,
and no heretical turbulence had yet disturbed the
sacerdotal empyrean, could hardly fail to recall a
tolerably brilliant galaxy of such ladies, as were
especially attracted from all parts of Italy, to a
court whose numerous and wealthy courtiers were
all professionally and permanently bachelors.</p>

<p>"Poor Giulia!" sighed the Archbishop, "sometimes
I wonder what became of her?"</p>

<p>We will not ask for a reference to the accurate
historian, who overheard, and has chronicled these
words. Roccho Pirro, in his learned and voluminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
history of the Sicilian prelates, it is true, omits to
mention them. Yet, I think, that if his Eminence,
Pietro Tagliavia d'Aragona, had been satisfactorily
Boswellised, they must have been recorded. For
"poor Giulia" had been the mother<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the rising
young churchman's daughter some fifty years or so
before the time at which we find his Eminence
working in his vocation at the great dam. And this
daughter was the celebrated Tullia (more or less)
d'Aragona.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIULIA OF FERRARA.</div>

<p>What <i>did</i> become of poor Giulia? Giulia of
Ferrara, the most celebrated beauty of her day, in
all Italy: the noted toast of Rome,—the be–rhymed
of ecclesiastical sonnetteers—the sighed–for by purple–stockinged
swains: Giulia, the Aspasia of many a
frocked Pericles, and the mother of a royal–blooded
churchman's child! How should respectable Mnemosyne
know what becomes of such? Mnemosyne
mentions, with a blush, having just seen her once
in the pride of her beauty, flashing with cortège of
horses and attendants, and glitter through the streets
of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And that is all. Mnemosyne begs to be
asked nothing more about her; and proceeds to
relate with much complacency the fortunes and
preferments of the excellent Cardinal Archbishop,
the rules that he made for his clergy, and the
privileges and property he acquired for his Church.</p>

<p>Yet despite all this propriety on the part of respectable
Mnemosyne, despite her decent reticences,
and official records of Palermo chapterhouse doings,
and Trent diplomacy, despite learned Roccho Pirro's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
folios and immortality in the columns of Ciacconius,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
the fact is, that if the name of Archbishop Peter
Tagliavia d'Aragona is ever now spoken by the lips
of living nineteenth–century men, it is owing, incredible
as the circumstance would have seemed to his
Eminence, solely to his relationship to little <i>nullius
filia</i> Tullia. Not that the blood–royal young churchman,
candidate as he was there at Rome, under the
immediate eye of infallibility for the Church's highest
honours—scarlet stockings, palliums, red hats, and
what not—seems to have felt any scruples and
embarrassment about the matter. At all events
he provided abundantly for his "furtively received
daughter," as Zilioli phrases it; and took care that
she should receive an education, calculated to make
the most of the brilliant talents of all sorts, manifested
by her from her earliest childhood. "To the
utter astonishment of learned men," says Zilioli, "she
was heard to carry on a disputation in Latin while
yet a child. She wrote also both in Latin and in
Italian compositions worthy of any literary man.
So that, when grown up, joining as she did, to her
knowledge and worth, an exquisite elegance of manner,
she acquired the reputation of being the most
perfectly accomplished woman of her time. She
appeared in public with so much grace, with such
beauty, and such affability of manner, that when to
all that was added the magnificence and adornment
of dress, calculated to set off all the charms of her
person<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to the utmost, it is impossible to imagine
anything more charming and exquisitely finished than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
she was. Her musical touch was so exquisite, and
she managed her voice in singing so sweetly, that
the first professors were astonished at her performance.
She spoke with grace and with rare eloquence,
so that whether in light conversation or serious
discussion, she delighted and captivated her hearers,
like a second Cleopatra; and at the same time, her
lovely and ever cheerful features were not wanting in
those more potent charms, which admirers of female
beauty are wont to look for in a beautiful face."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</div>

<p>So richly had nature endowed, and so successfully
had art cultivated the child of the rising churchman!
Father and daughter were both, during those early
years of the sixteenth century, perfecting themselves
for their subsequent destinies in the strangely jumbled
social world of that wonderful old Rome; he duly
progressing towards scarlet stockings and hats; and
she to the somewhat similarly coloured promotion,
in the enjoyment of which, painfully blushing Mnemosyne
next authentically falls in with her.</p>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">ASPASIA REDIVIVA.</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is fancied, with small reason probably, that to
grow old is necessarily more disagreeable to women
than to men. And dates are therefore popularly held
to be especially detestable facts to the fair sex. If
this be so, the world in this matter, as in most
others, showed itself excessively complaisant to our
fascinating sixteenth century, Aspasia. For her contemporaries
have been most strangely silent on the
subject as regards her. The year of her birth, and
more strangely still, that of her death, are alike
unknown and undiscoverable. Must we therefore
conclude, that the departure of the superannuated
beauty, was as little interesting to the world as the
arrival of the "furtively received" infant?</p>

<p>The literary historians content themselves with
vaguely stating, that Tullia "flourished" in 1550.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
It is true, that a difference of opinion may be
supposed to exist as to the portion of her career
best deserving to be so characterised. But it is to
be feared, that poor Tullia herself must have considered
her "flourishing" to be over and gone for
ever, by the time she reached that period. For in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the total silence and negligence of every regular
clerk in Mnemosyne's office, some not–to–be–baffled,
Dryasdust, whom our brilliant Tullia would doubtless
have hated with instinctive aversion, has succeeded
in poking out a certain letter that blabs much.
Ah! those old letters in dusty yellow bundles, with
the unimpeachable evidences of their signatures,
addresses, and dates, hoarded by some correspondent's
preserving instincts, in many cases little counted on
by the writer, how much of all we know about our
predecessors on earth's surface is due to their unforeseen
tale–telling!</p>

<div class="sidenote">FILIPPO STROZZI.</div>

<p>In the year 1531, Rome was settling down into
her usual way of life, after the dreadful catastrophes
of 1527. Pope Clement the Seventh had got over
the most perilous and immediate of his troubles,
but was, as Popes are wont to be, very much in need
of assistance from his banker. Now, this necessary
and important person was no other than the celebrated
Filippo Strozzi, who was then in Rome, busied
in the political as well as the monetary affairs of
the papacy. But Strozzi was one of those marvellous
men, whose abounding vital energies enable them to
unite in their own persons, characters, pursuits, and
occupations, which might seem to belong to half a
dozen most dissimilar individuals. His political
speculations and intrigues did not interfere with his
much–loved literary pursuits. His free–thinking philosophy
did not prevent his close intimacy with the
Pope. And his vast commercial and banking operations
were somehow made compatible with the career
of a very notorious man of pleasure.</p>

<p>How nearly two of the manifestations of this multiform
character would occasionally chance to jostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
each other, is indicated by the conclusion of a long
and important letter<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> on matters of high political
moment to Francesco Vettori. "Write to me in
reply," he says, "and be sure, that your letter shall
be seen by no one but His Holiness, as I desire
may be the case with this of mine, written in much
haste, and with Tullia at my side." Dated, Rome,
28th January, 1531.</p>

<p>Was the bewitching Tullia close enough to his
side to look over his shoulder, as the plotting politician
wrote matters to be shown only to the Pope?
Did she interest herself in schemes for the keeping
a Florentine oligarchy in check? Or did she sit
patiently at the writer's elbow, while he penned a
letter of sixty–four lines of small print, waiting till
he was at leisure to bestow some attention on his
companion? In either case the degree of intimacy
indicated is much closer than an ordinary one. Yet
the next letter,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> written little more than a month
later to the same correspondent, seems in its sadly
Don–Juan–like tone, to afford very clear evidence
that the writer, if not already tired of his gifted
Sappho, certainly considered his <i>liaison</i> with her in
the nature of a "terminable contract."</p>

<p>After a few lines on political matters, this Don
Juan of a middle–aged banker<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> writes as follows:</p>

<p>"As for my own private affairs, I should be sorry,
that you should have believed certain silly stories of
challenges and quarrels, about matters which in truth
passed amicably among friends here. For though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
I do not pretend to take rank among your very
prudent people, still I don't want to be set down as
a perfect fool, as truly I should deserve to be, had
I got into any such scrape for Tullia, or any other
woman. She is not, as you say, beautiful; but she
is, if I am not mistaken, highly gifted with talent
and wit; and on that account, as it is impossible to
me to live without the society of women, I have
preferred hers to that of others.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And I have
assisted her in some of her necessities, to prevent
her from going to the wall by unjust oppression,
during the period of my connection with her, which
would have been painful and discreditable to me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">DATE OF HER BIRTH.</div>

<p>The date of this letter is March the 2nd, 1531.</p>

<p>And as this date, with that of the preceding letter,
are among the very few of any kind discoverable with
reference to Tullia's biography, we must make the
most of them. It is to be presumed, then, from the
above passages, that she must have been at least
twenty, and probably older, in 1531. But as her
father died in 1558, and appears to have been engaged
in active business up to the time of his death, and as
no intimation is found of his age, as would probably
have been the case, if he had lived to be remarkably
old, we can hardly be very far wrong, in supposing him
to have been about seventy at the time of his death,
and accordingly two–and–twenty in 1510. It would
seem, therefore, that Tullia could not have been born
much before, and certainly not much after that date.</p>

<p>In one respect, however, poor Tullia was assuredly
wronged by the wealthy and libertine Florence banker.
He says that she was not beautiful. Now, the testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of a dozen enamoured poets might be adduced
in favour of her rare and fascinating beauty. And if
it should be thought that evidence of this kind, however
abundant and concurrent, needs confirmation,
it has been supplied by the sister art. There is an
admirable portrait of her by Bonvicini, a contemporary
of Raphael, more generally known as Il Moretto da
Brescia, which was engraved very tolerably at Milan,
in 1823, by Caterina Piotti. It represents a very
lovely face of the genuine regal type of Roman
beauty. The brow is noble; and the magnificently
cut, but rather large and statuesque features might
perhaps seem somewhat hard in the firmness of their
rich contour, were not the expression softened by an
eye eloquent of all the tenderer emotions. Laurel
branches fill the whole background of the picture, in
token of the lady's rank as a poetess.</p>

<p>How long after the date of the above–mentioned
letters Tullia continued her residence in Rome, there
remain no means of ascertaining. Zilioli says that
she left it "after the death of her husband." And
this one phrase is the only intimation of any sort we
meet with, that such a person as Tullia's husband
ever existed. It is true that such an appendage is not
of a nature likely to be dwelt much on in love verses
addressed to a lady. And to this category belong
the greatest number of the notices of her, which have
come down to us. Yet it seems strange that a wife
should be celebrated from one end of Italy to the
other, and recorded, or at least mentioned, in the
pages of every literary historian of her country, and
that she should have a husband whose name even was
never, as it should seem, alluded to by his cotemporaries,
and who has not left the slightest trace of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
existence. It must be supposed that, if ever spoken
of at all, he was only known as "La Tullia's" husband,
a member of society discharging functions
somewhat analogous to those of a Ballerina's mama.
It is, at all events, certain that the lady was never
known either among her contemporaries, or subsequently,
by any other name than that of Tullia
d'Aragona, and more commonly simply "La Tullia."
And the strangeness of the view of sixteenth century
society offered to us by an examination of the
position "La Tullia" occupied in it, is not a little
increased by the fact of her having had a sort of
behind–the–scenes husband, who appears to have exercised
about as much influence on her social standing
as her waiting–maid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER HUSBAND.</div>

<p>There is reason to suppose that her residence in
Rome must have continued till 1540 or 1541. For
among the "Strozziane"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> MSS. preserved in the
Magliabecchian library at Florence, there is a volume
containing the rules, members' names, transactions,
&amp;c. of the Academy of the "Humidi," in which are
entered three or four sonnets sent from Rome to the
Society by Tullia. They are not dated; but the
Academy was founded in 1540, and the volume bears
at the end the date of 1541. Nothing can be conceived
more insipid and dry, than the lucubrations
of these "Humid" Academicians; and in truth the
effusions despatched to them by Tullia, and honoured
by the Academy with insertion in their solemn
Archives, are quite worthy of their place in the Humid
annals. One is a sonnet in praise of Cosmo I.
It begins "Almo pastor," and attributes to that lowminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
debauchee and cruel tyrant all the virtues
that can possibly be packed into fourteen lines.</p>

<p>And this was written a couple of years after Filippo
Strozzi (the very particular friend and protector, by
whose side it was a pleasure to sit, while he wrote
long business letters in 1531) put himself to death in
despair, in preference to remaining in the power of
Cosmo, his mortal and vindictive enemy. One might
suspect that the fair Tullia had had an opportunity
of looking over his shoulder also when he was writing
that second letter, in which he had dared to say that
she was not beautiful!</p>

<p>Another of the sonnets sent by Tullia, and preserved
by the "Humidi," is inscribed to Maria Salviati,
and begins—</p>

<p class="pn p1 center reduct">
"Soul pure and bright, as when thou cam'st from God!"
</p>

<p class="pn p1">Whence it may be inferred that there was in those
days no such yawning abyss between the "monde"
and "demi–monde," as to prevent a lady highly placed
in the former from being addressed acceptably by one
who, according to nineteenth century notions, must be
deemed a denizen of the latter.</p>

<p>It must be understood, however, that any such
phrase applied to Tullia's social position in her own
sixteenth century, would give a very erroneous idea of
what that in reality was. The classic Hetaira seems
more akin to this Apollo–chartered libertine of an age
bent on being equally classical.</p>

<p>Accordingly we find that the house of La Tullia—<i>her</i>
house! no mention or hint of that Junius–like
individual (Il Tullio, shall we call him?), who must
nevertheless be supposed to have been at home there
under hatches somewhere, or acting perhaps as groom–porter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and shouting the names and titles of the
Monsignori and Eminences, as they arrived;—the
house of La Tullia was frequented by the "best
society" in Rome. Ludovico Domenichi of Piacenza,
himself a poet and a curious specimen of a sixteenth
century professional literary man, who must have
known Tullia at Florence in the latter years of her
life, has recorded some of the sayings and doings of a
company assembled at her house in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A PARTY AT HER HOUSE.</div>

<p>A party of "gentilhuomini virtuosi" there were
discussing Petrarch; and the question was raised,
how far he had availed himself of ideas suggested to
him by ancient Tuscan and Provençal poets. While
this was being debated, "L'Humore da Bologna"
came in. This personage is mentioned frequently by
Domenichi as a sayer and doer of eccentricities
and droll things; but I have not succeeded in finding
any account of him; and think it probable that
"L'Humore" may have been one of those nicknames
which the Italians are so fond of bestowing on one
another. He at once showed himself to be quite at
home, says Ludovico, laid aside his cloak; and entering
into the conversation, gave it as his opinion that
Petrarch had served the verses of his predecessors as
Spaniards serve the cloaks, which they steal in the
night; put fresh ornaments and trimmings on them,
so that when they appear in them the next day, they
are no longer recognisable. Upon which a Spaniard,
who chanced to be among the company, attempted to
call "L'Humore" to account for this insulting mention
of his countrymen. "What!" cried the wit, "is your
Excellency a Spaniard? Boy, bring me my cloak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
directly!" And so saying, he put it on, and wrapped
it closely round him, as he sat, to the infinite amusement,
says Domenichi, of the assembled company.</p>

<p>After the death of that mysterious phantom, her
husband, says Zilioli, Tullia left Rome in search of
"fresh fields and pastures new." We can only know
that this was after 1540. But it must have been
much after this that she took up her residence in
Florence. For the same writer tells us, that she was
then both in years and appearance pretty nearly an
old woman.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In 1562 she was, according to the date
we have assigned to her birth, only fifty–two or three,
or thereabouts. And she must have resided in
Florence several years prior to that date. For she
lived there, we are told, under the patronage of
Cosmo's Duchess Eleonora of Toledo, who died in
that year. So that she could not have been much
more than half–way between forty and fifty, when she
appeared to be "half an old woman."</p>

<p>Supposing her to have gone to Florence about 1555,
and to have left Rome not long after 1540, there is a
space of some twelve or fifteen years, during which
we very nearly lose all sight of her.</p>

<p>Very nearly, but not quite; for we hear of long
residences at Venice and Ferrara; and can trace her to
Bologna by a phrase in an epigram too coarsely abusive
to be reproduced, which Pasquin fired after her when
she quitted Rome. Little cared the brilliant poetess—errant
for pasquinades let off behind her back, while
her course from one pleasure–loving court to another
was tracked, as Zilioli writes, by "an infinite number
of lovers, especially among the poets, who pursued her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
like a pack of greyhounds, striving to bring her down
by volleys of odes and sonnets," to which our not
insensible Sappho was ready enough to reply in
similar strain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SONNET BY HER.</div>

<p class="b1">Here, as a specimen of "her make," as the Italians
say, is a sonnet addressed by her to Pietro Manelli, of
Florence, who was one of her most devoted slaves:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Qual vaga Filomena, che fuggita<br />
È dall'odiata gabbia, ed in superba<br />
Vista sen va tra gli arboscelli e l'erba<br />
Tornata in libertate, e lieta vita;</p>
<p class="psi20">Ed io dagli amorosi lacci uscita,<br />
Schernendo ogni martir, e pena acerba<br />
Dell'incredibil duol, che in se riserba<br />
Qual ha per troppo amar l'alma smarrita;</p>
<p class="psi20">Ben avev'io ritolte, ahi stella fiera!<br />
Dal tempio di Ciprigna le mie spoglie<br />
E di lor premio me n'andava altera.</p>
<p class="psi20">Quando a me Amor; le tue ritrose voglie<br />
Muterò, disse; e femmi prigioniera<br />
Di tua virtù, per rinovar mie doglie."</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Which may be Englished as follows, without, it is to
be hoped, any very cruel injury to the original:</p>

<p class="psq20">"As when from her abhorr'd captivity<br />
Fair Philomel hath fled, and proudly takes<br />
Her way through grassy meads and bushy brakes<br />
Restored to joyous life and liberty;</p>
<p class="psi20">So I, from amorous bonds escaping free,<br />
All torment scorning, and the poignant aches<br />
Of grief untold, which too much loving makes<br />
The doom of such, as love–bewilder'd be,</p>
<p class="psi20">Had borne (alas! my hapless stars!) away<br />
My garments from the Cyprian Goddess' shrine<br />
Proud of the feat, when Love to me did say,</p>
<p class="psi20">'I will transform that stubborn will of thine;'<br />
And so he made me captive to thy power,<br />
Renewing all my torments from that hour."</p>

<p class="p1">This sonnet is not worse than thousands of other
such, which obtained for their fabricators the name
and reputation of poets in that age of vaunted intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
movement; and it is certainly better than the
majority of them.</p>

<p>And thus our brilliant Aspasia of the <i>renaissance</i>
fluttered from court to court, everywhere received
with open arms, everywhere the cynosure of all eyes,
everywhere the centre of a knot of poets and <i>littérateurs</i>;
and flashing off her sonnets and canzonets
right and left; now as offerings to be laid at the feet
of some most illustrious duke or duchess, and now in
loving or saucy requital of those addressed to her by
her brethren of the guild.</p>

<p class="b1">But as</p>

<p class="psq20">"All that's bright must fade,<br />
The brightest still the fleetest,"</p>

<p class="pn p1">the inexorable years too soon brought poor Tullia to
that period of "half old–womanhood," as Zilioli so
uncourteously terms it, which must have nearly coincided
with the date assigned by grave Mazzuchelli to
that period of "flourishing," which, it is to be feared,
the "half–old woman" would have fixed some five–and–twenty
years earlier.</p>

<p>And what was to be done by a brilliant Apollo–chartered
Aspasia, when fallen into half old–womanhood?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center p1 mid">"ALL'S WELL, THAT ENDS WELL."</p>

<p class="pn p2">One of two alternatives only, according to the well–known
<i>dictum</i> of a judicious French philosopher,
could be adopted by any Aspasia or other "charming
woman" whatsoever, when brought to that pass. She
must either take to cards, or "enter into devotion."
Such would seem, according to the authority alluded
to, to be the law of nature, which rules the destinies
of charming women whose charms have gone from
them. Tullia appears to have chosen the latter alternative,
and established herself permanently at Florence
under the special protection of the pious Duchess
Eleonora di Toledo.</p>

<p>The times were changed, too, in Italy, since the
days of Tullia's youth. Life in Rome, and hence in
a somewhat less degree also in the other centres of
the peninsula, was very different under Popes Paul IV.
and Pius IV., from what it had been under Leo X.,
Clement VII., or Paul III. Devotion was now the
<i>mode</i>, especially in courts. Princes had begun to
understand, that the cause of despotism was bound up
with that of sacerdotal tyranny; and that reform in
matters ecclesiastical went hand in hand with freedom
in matters secular. Popes and kings had become aware,
that their fight against mankind could only be carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
on successfully by strict offensive and defensive alliance.
Hence orthodox piety was one of the surest
roads to court favour. And thus considerations of all
sorts united in pointing out to Tullia the expediency
of quitting <i>La Bohème</i>, and becoming at once a
respectable member of society, and a pattern of
propriety.</p>

<p>Literature, however, of a courtly sort was held in
much favour at the court of Cosmo, who founded
academies and kept historians in his pay, to set him
and his doings before posterity in a proper point of
view. Tullia, therefore, in quitting the "pays de la
Bohème," did not leave her muse behind her. On the
contrary, her most important work was the production
of this period of her life.</p>

<p>"Guerrino il Meschino" is a poem consisting of
some thirty thousand lines, in thirty–six cantos of
octave rhyme. The poetess states in her preface,
that it is a versification of a Spanish original; an assertion
which has given some trouble to bibliographers;
for the story of Guerrino was popular in Italian prose
long before the time of Tullia, and has indeed continued
so, quite independently of her poetical version,
to such a degree as to have afforded the subject of
popular dramatic representation within the present
century. Some importance has been attached to the
question of its origin from the circumstance of its
having been supposed to have suggested to Dante
some part of the plan of his poem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GUERRINO IL MESCHINO.</div>

<p>In an article on Dantescan literature, by M. Charles
Labitte, in the 31st vol. of the second series of the
<i>Révue des Deux Mondes</i>, he says, that "it has been
maintained that Dante took directly from the old
romance of 'Guerrino il Meschino' the subject and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the entire plan of his work. The date and the origin
of the Guerrino, whether French or Provençal, are
uncertain.... Hell is represented in it with the
concentric form attributed to it by Dante, and Satan
in both cases occupies the lowest part of the abyss.
But it would be easy to show, despite the weighty
authority of Pelli and of Fontanini, that the romance
of Guerrino, so popular in the fifteenth century, is
at least in its present form posterior to the Divine
Comedy."</p>

<p>The fact is, however, that the idea of describing the
adventures and sights encountered by a denizen of
this world, or his travels through the world beyond
the tomb, was exceedingly common in the century
preceding Dante; and we find it reproduced in many
different forms. And in all probability the story of
Guerrino was popular long before it was written in the
earliest shape in which we now have it.</p>

<p>The contents are of the ordinary staple of the
romances of chivalry, unreadable enough for the most
part. Crescimbeni declares<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that the story is comparable
to the Odyssey; while the more critical
Mazzuchelli finds it "full of improbabilities, utterly
contrary to history, chronology, and geography."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Tullia's own view of her work, and her account of
her motives in writing it, as set forth in her preface,
are more to our present purpose. She begins by
observing, that whereas all other pleasures either
require the ministration of others, whose services we
may not always be able to command, or are of such
a nature as to be of short duration, like eating and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
drinking, or again bring with them dangers, expense,
anxiety, and often mischief,—such as travelling, gambling,
love–making, and such–like; reading alone is
open to none of these inconveniences. Accordingly
everybody above the lowest classes, says Tullia, reads
now–a–days; and for women it is a resource especially
useful and necessary, as Giovanni Boccaccio well
knew, who informed us that he wrote almost entirely
for the ladies. And had he only done one thing which
he has left undone, and left undone one which he has
done, his book would have been all that could have
been desired. The first is to have put his tales
into verse, which it cannot be doubted, says our
poetess, is much more pleasant reading than prose.
The other matter, which should have been avoided,
is the quantity of "improper, indecent, and truly
abominable things which are found from one end
to the other of that book, in which no respect is
paid to the honour of married women, nor of
widows, nor of nuns, nor of secular damsels, nor
of godmothers or godfathers, nor of friends, nor
of priests, nor of friars, and, lastly, not even of
bishops. So that it is truly a thing to wonder at
that not only princes and superiors, but even thieves
and felons, who call themselves Christians, can bear
to hear his name mentioned, without signing themselves
with the Holy Cross, and stopping their ears
as against the most horrible and abominable thing
that human ears could listen to. Yet so utterly
corrupt is our nature, that not only is this book
not avoided as an abomination, but every one runs
after it."</p>

<p>Poor dear Tullia's virtue fresh taken up from grass,
runs away with her a little! It is quite clear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
there are to be no more cakes and ale for any body,
now that her junketing days are done!</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER PROPRIETY.</div>

<p>She goes on to complain that all the romance writers,
"even Ariosto himself," are disfigured by the same
fault. She therefore, intent on finding some pleasant
reading with no offence in it, met with this "exquisite
book in the Spanish tongue, in which so many and
various matters are treated of, that I assuredly know
of none so pleasant in that language or any other.
And then it is throughout perfectly chaste, perfectly
pure, thoroughly Christian; and neither in the facts
nor diction is there anything which any respectable
and holy man or woman, married or single, nun or
widow, may not read at all hours."</p>

<p>This treasure of a book therefore she determines to
clothe with verse, the only thing wanting to make it
perfect. It is for you therefore, "my gentle readers,
to accept my good intention, and give all the praise to
God alone, from whom comes all good, and to whom
alone I am thankful for the great grace which has so
enlightened me while yet not over–ripe, but youthful
and fresh in age,—<i>in questa mia età non ancor soverchiamente
matura, ma giovenile e fresca</i>,—as to bring
back my heart to Him, and make me wish and strive,
as far as in me lies, that all others, both men and
women, may have like grace."</p>

<p>How delightfully the vein of natural womanhood
crops out from under the thick overlying strata of
propriety and devoutness! Poor Tullia! And to
think of that wretch of a biography–man Zilioli, talking
of "half–old–womanhood in years and in appearance,"
in speaking of a period anterior to this!</p>

<p>It might be supposed, on the principle of setting a
thief to catch a thief, that our Sappho sanctified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
animated with the excellent dispositions she manifests,
would have avoided the faults she so furiously inveighs
against. But that hallucination of her "not
yet over–ripe age" would seem to have come upon her
so strongly at times, as to have caused her to think
the old thoughts and talk the old <i>Bohème</i> talk of her
youth, in total forgetfulness of her present character,
and all the promises of her preface. Mazzuchelli, in
noticing this preface of hers, briefly and gravely
remarks that certain passages of her poem, which he
refers to, show that she has not attained the object
she aimed at. It is, however, difficult to say what
Tullia may have deemed proper reading for nuns and
damsels at all hours. And if any English readers
wish to judge of this for themselves, they may be
satisfied by consulting the tenth canto of the poem;
which contains matters that would among us be considered
very undesirable reading for any section of the
community at any hours.</p>

<p>To this reformed period of Tullia's life belongs
also her dialogue "On the infinity of Love." It
professes to be the report of a conversation that
took place at her house in Florence, between herself
and Benedetto Varchi, the historian and philosopher;
and it no doubt in a great degree resembles the style
of talk affected at the quasi–academic meetings of
friends, which constituted the then fashionable form
of social intercourse. It was first printed at Venice
in 1547, in a small volume of some two or three
hundred pages, with a preface by Girolamo Muzio,
one of Tullia's most fervent and most constant
adorers. He commences his preface by drawing a
distinction between spiritual and material love, and
declares that his affection for the authoress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
dialogue is purely of the former kind. The work
was sent to him, he says, by Tullia, without any idea
of publication; and he had ventured to send it to
the press without her knowledge. In the manuscript,
as it reached him, the name "Sabina" stood as
Varchi's interlocutor, in the place of "Tullia;" "doubtless,"
says Muzio, "because the writer's modesty was
shocked at writing in her own name all the praises
that Varchi is made to bestow on her in the course
of the work." But he, Muzio, thinking that a feigned
name could not with propriety be introduced in
conjunction with the real name of Varchi, had decided
on inserting the name of Tullia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER DIALOGUE ON LOVE.</div>

<p>The production itself is a truly wonderful proof
of the amount of difference that may exist between
the average cultivated human intellect in one age and
country and in another. This dialogue on the infinity
and necessary durability of love, is one of
hundreds of similar writings on that and other such
subjects, which constituted the fashionable and much–enjoyed
light reading of the educated classes in Italy
at that period. To a modern English reader, no
dryest blue book, no trashiest novel could appear so
perfectly unreadable. The subject presented to a
man of our day as the theme for an essay, might
seem somewhat stiff and formal—<i>banal</i>, as the French
say; but he would see at once, that the consideration
of it might lead to the discussion of several questions
closely touching some of the most interesting
and important problems of social polity. But Tullia
and her contemporaries saw nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>Nor let any saucy scapegrace imagine, that any
experiences of the different attributes of Eros and
Anteros, which the authoress may be supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
have acquired in the course of her life, are in any
wise brought to bear on any part of her theme. The
dialogue might be innocently, if not profitably, read
by any of those damsels and nuns for whom Tullia
specially prepared her less immaculate poem. There
are scholastically constructed argumentations, quotations
from Petrarch and Dante, syllogisms, with talk
of major and minor premise, and plenty of references
to Aristotle, a little horribly <i>fade</i> and mild raillery
between the lady and Varchi, and words—words—words,
with such weary going backwards and forwards
over the same dry places paved with them, as would
make an admirable substitute for the treadmill in the
case of felons of education.</p>

<p>There are no means of knowing for how many
years Tullia continued her pleasant life of literary
occupation and society, with all that was most cultivated
and agreeable in Florence. She would have
published other things on which she was engaged,
says Zilioli, "had she not been surprised by death
before she had reached that extreme old age, which
Pietro Angelio of Barga, a most able astrologer, had
promised her, possibly with a view of acquiring favour
in her eyes."</p>

<p>Her patroness, Eleonora of Toledo, who despite
many virtues and good qualities, was odious to the
Florentines, on account of her "insopportabile gravità,"
says Litta,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> because, that is, she was with her Spanish
seriousness and gravity an intolerable bore to the
light–hearted Tuscans,—died in 1562. And in all
probability Tullia did not survive her many years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON.</div>

<p>The name of Tullia d'Aragona lives in the pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of Italian literary historians, and in the memory of
educated Italians as a poetess. But she would not
have merited presentation to the English reader as
such. As a remarkable social phenomenon, the product
of the social soil of the sixteenth century under
the sun of the <i>renaissance</i>, the story of her life,
imperfect as it is, is well worth notice.</p>

<p class="pbqi">Good Old Times in Ferrara—How a Pope's Daughter became a
Duchess—Bygones were bygones—and Love was still the Lord
of all.</p>

<p class="pn p2">A certain class of writers, probably among the
most sincere and earnest of the defenders of the
Catholic faith, have been driven by the social aspect
presented by all those countries in which Catholicism
has power, to admit, accept, and justify the absence
of material, and even intellectual prosperity, as a
necessary consequence of catholic views of life here
and hereafter. Material prosperity, say these ascetics,—plenty
to eat and to drink, good clothing, commodious
habitations, life–embellishing arts, and ministrations
of all sorts to corporeal well–being, are not the proper
objects of man here on this earth. Nay, the wisest of
mankind have in all ages, they say, recognised such
things as highly inimical to the pursuit of that better
aim, to which all human endeavour should tend. While
the fatal consequences resulting from untrammelled
intellectual culture, are among the surest and saddest
teachings of human experience. That the true and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
faithful fashioning of life therefore in accordance
with the doctrines of a creed, the whole scope and
tendency of which is the undivided pursuit of that
higher and better aim, should be found unconducive
to material and merely human intellectual advantages,
is, they urge, not only what might reasonably be
anticipated, but is a confirmatory proof of the correctness
of those views, which it cannot be denied have
made Catholic countries what they are.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TENDENCIES OF CATHOLICISM.</div>

<p>Such doctrine, though little likely to be deemed
conclusive by enlightened intelligence, or acceptable
by the popular mind, has at all events the advantage
of moving the question into a strictly theological
court, into which the economist, the historian, the
moralist, the politician, and the philanthropist, are
not obliged to follow it. For their purposes it is
sufficient, that the tendency of Catholicism to produce
poverty, squalor, ignorance, and depopulation, should
be admitted and registered. And they may well
afford, at this period of the world's history, to treat
with a silent shrug, the theory of those, who declare
that these things are preferable to enlightenment,
abundance, and material prosperity.</p>

<p>But if it be indeed true, that intellectual and material
decadence is the proof and guarantee of a people's spiritual
advancement; if the desolating blight which marks
unmistakeably every land overshadowed by the wings of
the Roman Church, be indeed an indication of its ripeness
for a better harvest than any to be garnered on
this side of the grave; then assuredly may we expect
to find the purest and brightest spiritual life ever yet
manifested by a nation, among the happy populations—<i>fortunati
nimium sua si bona nôrint</i>—subjected to the
immediate sway of the successors of St. Peter. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
should any curious student of the <i>modus operandi</i>
and results of ecclesiastical government, desire to know
where he may advantageously examine such phenomena
in their most unmitigated form and perfect
development, he may be safely advised to bestow his
researches on the city and district of Ferrara.</p>

<p>There, indeed, the lesson he is in search of, is so
written, that he who runs, even though he speed on
with the haste of the posting traveller, eager to leave
the abomination of desolation behind him, may read
it without fear of blundering. There indeed is a
city and people unmistakably marked by Holy Mother
Church, as her own; silence and solitude, decay,
dilapidation, neglect, and sordid squallor, characterise
the impress of her paternal hand. And yet more
forcibly to point the moral of the spectacle, there
remains sufficient traces of what Ferrara was in the
young ungodly days of her lay government, to give
all the force of contrast to her present condition.
There is the gaunt frame of a city calculated to house
four times the amount of its present population. The
lofty walls of vast palaces enclose wide and spacious
streets, over which the green weeds are growing, and
a dead silence broods. In the centre is the moated
castle of the old Dukes of Ferrara, now the monstrously
disproportioned residence of the priest, who
governs (!) Ferrara and its legation. Around this
still lingers what little of life and movement is left
in the paralysis–struck city. The more distant streets
may be traversed from end to end without the sight
of a living creature, save perhaps a group of half–naked
mendicants basking in the sun, or the still
more unpleasing figure of a capuchin friar, sauntering
along with his wallet over his shoulder, on his daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
quest, like some unclean reptile of ill omen crawling
among ruins which are its appropriate dwelling–place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERRARA UNDER HER DUKES.</div>

<p>Such are the normal and necessary results as they
lie developed and palpable before our eyes, of that
system which was inaugurated at the period to which
the subject of these pages belongs. But let ascetic
theologians console themselves, and defend the issues
of their handywork, as they may, it is undeniable,
that, be they as sincere as they will, all such considerations
are but after–thoughts. The production
of a society vowed to apostolic poverty and heedlessness
of the morrow, was not the object which
the sixteenth century popes, and those misguided
rulers who played into their hands, had in view.
They intended to bring about very different issues.
Yet this, which we see, was the only one in the long
run possible, as the upshot of their doings. Divine
providence so over–ruled the matter, quite in accordance
with divine precedent, having very irreversibly
laid down the law for the regulation of all such cases,
at the time of man's first creation.</p>

<p>Previously to the inauguration of this fatal policy,
the rule of the earlier dukes of Ferrara of the house
of Este had aimed at, and in very considerable
degree attained, quite other results. Beginning with
old Borso the first duke, who was invested with that
dignity in 1471, and who left behind him so good a
name, that when in after and worser times, men
grumbled in Ferrara,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> they would say, "Ah, 'tis not
now as in Duke Borso's days," down to his great
nephew Hercules the Second, who ruled the duchy
at the period to which our subject belongs; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Ferrarese princes had been very favourable specimens
of the Italian sovereigns of those days.</p>

<p>As for good–old–times Borso, the just, though he
had not the advantage of book–learning himself, he
honoured it in others. The fact of his own deficiency
in this respect, we gather from the amusingly frank
avowal of a contemporary chronicler, who in a dedication
of his book to his sovereign,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> remarks that,
"Fortune, ever the enemy of worth, has not willed,
that to your other singular accomplishments should
be added that of literature." From the records of
his reign however, it would seem, that illiterate as
he was, he must have had talents, that would make
an invaluable chancellor of the exchequer. For the
same historians, who give us the most glowing
accounts of his magnificence assure us, that he never
oppressed his subjects with unjust or grievous taxation.
He dressed we are told, even when in the
country, in brocade and cloth of gold; he never went
without a chain about his neck of the value of seventy
thousand ducats (!!), kept seven hundred magnificent
horses in his stables, and dogs and falcons in proportion.
Then his buildings were on a scale that might
rival the doings of Napoleon the Third. But that
collar! We have heard of the oppressive weight of
the trappings of state, but little thought of the terrible
extent of the reality. For seventy thousand ducats
must be reckoned at the lowest calculation to be worth
at the present day thirty–five thousand pounds, and to
be equivalent to about two thousand two hundred and
fifty pounds weight of gold. Now, admitting that
nine–tenths of this value was represented by the exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
workmanship of the celebrated Venetian goldsmiths,
still we must suppose, poor Duke Borso to
have walked about the world with upwards of two
hundred weight of gold round his neck!</p>

<div class="sidenote">HERCULES THE FIRST.</div>

<p>Borso's brother, Hercules the First, who succeeded
to him in 1471, is also spoken of with high praise by
the contemporary chroniclers.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> They tell us, that
his title to the dukedom was maintained against
a collateral pretender by seventy thousand inhabitants
of Ferrara. He signalised his accession by
the remission of several taxes, which seems somewhat
incompatible with the praises previously bestowed on
Borso on that head; and still more so with the
accounts we have of his own magnificent doings.
For he also was a mighty builder both of palaces
and villas for his own pleasure, and of improved and
increased dwellings for that of his people. Towards
the end of the century, the population of Ferrara,
which we have already seen rated at seventy thousand,
had become so largely increased, chiefly in
consequence of the expulsion from Spain and Portugal
of the Jews, who thronged in great numbers
into Italy, and especially settled themselves at Ferrara
under the then tolerant rule of its popular dukes,
that a writer of the time<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> declares, that no dwelling
was to be found there for money. Hercules, therefore,
in 1492, undertook the herculean task of erecting
buildings to such a number as to double the size of
his capital.</p>

<p>The work was commenced on such a scale, that
the cautious Venetian senators, his neighbours, were
startled, and deemed it prudent to ask what was intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
by such vast preparations for construction.
Duke Hercules answered, that he was building houses
for his subjects to live in, and the Queen of the
Adriatic seems to have been contented with the reply.
Various taxes were imposed, not on Ferrara only,
but on the whole of the Duke's dominions, including
Modena and Reggio, to supply the means of executing
these works. But there is no indication to be
found of their having been considered grievous or
excessive. And we have no means of ascertaining
whose property the newly–raised quarters of the city
were considered when built. Did they become crown
property, and thus enormously increase the already
large means of which the princes of the house of
Este disposed, independently of taxation? Or, as
seems under the circumstances of the case hardly
possible, were any accounts kept, and means adopted
to make the proceeds of the new property available,
in the shape of interest, to those who had contributed
to their expense?</p>

<p>Next to his ruling passion for building, spectacles
of all sorts, dramatic and others, and travelling, were
the great delight of Hercules I. All these were
costly pleasures; and we find that, in contradiction to
the policy of the early days of his reign, want of
money often induced him to lay heavy burthens on
his subjects. Nevertheless, he had the art of making
himself exceedingly beloved by his people. He never
hoarded money, but spent it almost entirely among
the citizens in making his court and capital the gayest
and most splendid in Italy. It was always "festa,"
always carnival at Ferrara. "Tournaments, races of
horses, of oxen, of asses, of girls and boys, shooting
matches, and hunting parties succeeded each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
without interruption."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Then the good Duke would
sally forth o' nights, and looking in quite unexpectedly
take pot luck at supper with his loving subjects, in
genuine Caliph Haroun Alraschid fashion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALPHONSO THE FIRST.</div>

<p>Neither then nor at any other time was any court
in Italy so thronged with men of learning and genius.
For such, come they from what nation they might,
there was always a warm welcome, and assistance, if
they needed it. Then again the court of Ferrara was
a noted resort of noble knights, who had differences
touching their honour, to put to the arbitrement
of the sword. For the sport–loving Duke was always
ready to afford a tilting–ground, and the countenance
of his august presence to champions in need of such
accommodation. Many accordingly were the celebrated
duels which came off at Ferrara, to the infinite
satisfaction and diversion of the Duke and his subjects.
Then as for his piety, if all the churches and
monasteries he built were not enough to vouch for it,
says Frizzi, piously, it is abundantly proved by his
habit of going to various churches accompanied by all
his famous band, there to have mass celebrated with
all the attractions of music. Besides, in holy week, he
used to wash the feet of hundreds of old men! What
more would you have?</p>

<p>His son Alphonso, born in 1476, succeeded him in
1505. This prince's first wife, Anna Strozzi, having
died in 1477, he married in 1501 the too celebrated
Lucrezia Borgia. That such a marriage could have
been thought possible, that it should have been
proposed to the court of Ferrara, and accepted
by Alphonso and his father, are facts which very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
strikingly set before us the vastness of the difference
between the habits of thought and feeling of an
Italian of the fifteenth and an Englishman of the
nineteenth century. The consideration of a gulf of
separation so impassable warns us of the exceeding
difficulty of so sympathising with the men of that
time and country, as to form any tolerably fair appreciation
of their conduct; not merely in the sense of
morally judging of it, with reference to the responsibilities
of the individual, with which wholly impossible
task we have fortunately no need to meddle; but in
the sense of comprehending the bearing and weight
of the motives which regulated it.</p>

<p>Lucrezia was twenty–five at the time of this her
fourth marriage. What the tenour of her life had
been, and the nature of the scenes she had passed
through, the English reader is probably in some small
degree aware; in a very small degree, unless indeed
he happens to have sought out in the folio Latin
columns of the contemporary chroniclers the details
of abominations wholly unreproducible in any modern
page. And yet this woman, whose moral nature, if
judged according to our habits of thought, must be
deemed to have been saturated with impurity, and
hopelessly depraved and destroyed, is proposed and
accepted as the wife of a prince, whose character
stands higher than that of any of his contemporaries
of the sovereign houses of Italy, and whose family
was already remarkable among them for enlightenment
and respectability!—accepted to be the mother of his
children, and the means of transmitting his unsullied
name and crown!</p>

<p>A very noteworthy instance of the extraordinary
incompatibility of the moral feelings of those times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with our own, or of our imperfect appreciation of the
exact value of the terms used, occurs in a passage of
the "Relazione,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>" of the Venetian ambassador Paolo
Cappello, who, returning from Alexander the Sixth's
Court in 1500, tells the Senate that Lucrezia is "prudent
and liberal"—<i>savia e liberale</i>—and adds within
five lines, without further remark, that it is said, that
she had an incestuous connection with her brother!<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCREZIA BORGIA.</div>

<p>But perhaps the most extraordinary and interesting
fact of Lucrezia's history, is that after her marriage
with Alphonso, not only was her life blameless, but
her conduct was such as to merit and secure her high–minded
husband's affection and esteem, and in all
respects to do honour to her station. Her marriage
with Alphonso therefore divides, as by an abruptly
and suddenly drawn line, the life of Lucrezia into
two portions, the earlier all black with atrocities and
abominations unspeakable, the latter shining with
purity and many noble virtues. Such a statement
has been deemed to involve an absolute moral impossibility;
and Roscoe has been induced by the consideration
of it, to attempt a denial of the charges
which have made Lucrezia Borgia's name a by–word
of infamy.</p>

<p>"If the Ethiopian cannot change his skin," he
writes,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> "nor the leopard his spots, how are we to
conceive it possible that a person, who had during
so many years of her life been sunk into the lowest
depths of guilt and infamy could at once emerge to
respectability and virtue? The history of mankind
furnishes no instances of such a rapid change."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>But Roscoe's elaborate though weak defence signally
breaks down. It would extend what has already undesignedly
assumed the proportions of a digression far
too much to enter into an examination of the historical
evidence on the subject. It will be sufficient
to observe, that Roscoe's "chivalrous" attempt, as
somebody with infinite absurdity somewhere calls it,
was abundantly demolished by the "Edinbro' Review,"
January, 1806, at the time. And further evidence
than was then accessible to the reviewer, has since
been made available to establish the historical certainty,
that the earlier portion of Lucrezia's life was in
truth all that it has been ordinarily supposed to have
been. On the correctness of the account of the latter
portion, as stated above, no doubt has ever been cast.
So that we in reality have this whitewashed–black–a–moor
phenomenon before us, to make of it what
we may.</p>

<p>Gibbon disposes<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of the matter by observing, that
"perhaps the youth of Lucrezia had been seduced
by example; perhaps she had been satiated by pleasure;
perhaps she was awed by the authority of her
new parent and husband," Alphonso, and his father
Hercules. But the moral philosopher will hardly
deem any of these suppositions a satisfactory explanation
of the facts before him. And a more serious
consideration of them will perhaps lead him to the
conclusion, that whatever of strangeness or novelty
they may present, is rather matter for the historian's
study than for his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCREZIA BORGIA.</div>

<p>Well convinced of the reality of the impossibility
alleged, that any human being should pass suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
from such a moral state as that indicated to our judgments
by the facts of Lucrezia's early career, to such
an ethical condition as that presumed to accompany
her later life, while he in no wise seeks to invalidate
the historical evidence of the case, he will yet deny
such change to have been accomplished. Knowing
how large a portion of the spiritual deterioration
arising from any outward acts, is dependent on the
degree to which the conscience of the agent is enlightened,
he will deny that Lucrezia's moral state
during the first part of her life was such as we are
apt to conceive that it needs must have been. Aware
how very much of the difficulty of turning from evil
to good, consists in the arduousness of the struggle
to rise from infamy to good repute, he will assert,
that Lucrezia could not have been sunk in that depth
of infamy to which we suppose that the admitted
facts of her conduct must necessarily have consigned
her.</p>

<p>For the moralist there will be nothing new or
striking in all this. The interesting significance of
the phenomenon is for the historian. That restoration
and <i>rehabilitation</i>, it would appear, which would be
impossible in the nineteenth, was possible in the
fifteenth century. The gulf which would now be
wholly impassable, did not then yawn so wide as to
make crossing it impossible. Here is to be found
the explanation, and herein consists the historical
interest of the facts of the case. The finely organised
moral sense of the nineteenth century would have
been wholly killed by similar wounds, and the spiritual
destruction of the individual would have been irretrievable.
But the lower, coarser, more rudimentary
moral sense of the "ages of faith" was not wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
killed by such injuries. And the extraordinary social
phenomenon of the marriage is only explicable in the
same manner. The moral reprobation, which among
us would doom such an offender to the isolation of
a leper, did not exist in that age and country. When
the aged Pontiff Paul III. characterised the even
more horrible atrocities of his son Piero Luigi
Farnese as juvenile indiscretions, though the respectable
world of the sixteenth century was revolted, the
discrepancy between the moral judgment of Heaven's
vicegerent and that of his faithful people, was very
far from being as monstrous as that between his and
our nineteenth century English feeling. The career
of Lucrezia was also doubtless deemed highly reprehensible
by her contemporaries. Indeed we find it
made the subject of invective and epigram. But it
is clear, that none of the horror and the loathing
attached to it with which we now regard it. It is
evident that she was not deemed hopelessly and
irrecoverably soiled and destroyed by it.</p>

<p>And such proofs of the enormous amount of the
advance in the moral sense of mankind, which has
been accomplished in the world, that according to
theologians, has been staggering onwards amid tottering
creeds and ever–multiplying heresies towards a
religious cataclysm, are among the most important
fruits of historical study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCREZIA'S MARRIAGE.</div>

<p>When the marriage was first proposed to the court
of Ferrara by Alexander VI., both Alphonso and his
father Hercules were extremely averse to it<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. The
Pope induced Louis XII. to use his influence with
the Ferrarese princes; and the king deputed a posse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of churchmen, the Cardinal of Rohan, the Archdeacon
of Chalon, and the Archbishop of Narbonne, to persuade
Hercules and his son of the desirableness of
such an union. Their arguments seem to have consisted
entirely in setting forth the dangers that would
arise to Ferrara from refusal. The father was thus
first brought over. Alphonso still expressed the
greatest reluctance. But when his father declared,
that under the pressure of the circumstances, he would
himself, were it not for his advanced age, accept the
hand of Lucrezia, the son consented.</p>

<p>The bribes administered by the Pope in the shape
of dower, were very considerable. The investiture of
his Duchy, which had hitherto been conferred by the
Apostolic see for three generations only, was made
perpetual. The tribute payable on account of it was
reduced from four thousand ducats to one hundred
florins. An hundred thousand ducats was also paid
down in gold; and the bride carried with her to
Ferrara the value of an hundred and seventeen thousand
ducats in precious stones and jewelry; besides
a proportionate amount of property in dresses and
furniture. And it was especially provided in the
marriage contract, that, in case of Lucrezia's death,
Alphonso should not be called on to restore any
portion of this property.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The marriage was celebrated at Rome on the 29th
December, 1501, Alphonso's brother Don Ferrante
standing proxy for the bridegroom.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February the bride reached Ferrara,
where the preparations for receiving her may be said
to have been nearly the sole occupation of the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
city, during the interval between the marriage and
her arrival in her new home. And although Donna
Lucrezia and her extraordinary marriage have already
too much lengthened these notices of the court of
Ferrara, the only scope of which is to give the reader
some idea of the scene on which the subject of these
pages is to appear, yet some of the details of these
preparations, as recorded by the contemporary diarist
above cited, afford so curious a peep at the manners
and customs of the period, that the somewhat undue
extension of a merely prefatory chapter will probably
be pardoned for the sake of the interest attaching to
them.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of December, the diarist notes, that
fourteen bushels of comfits were already prepared,
counting up to that night, and that the ducal confectioners
would continue to increase the store with
all diligence. It has been seen already how large
a part preparations of sugar played on all such
occasions.</p>

<p>Then we have a very curious illustration of a custom,
traces of which still remain among the people in several
parts of Italy. On the night before the Epiphany,
children are in these days wont to hang up a stocking,
or some other such receptacle outside their chambers,
into which their friends put little presents, which the
child finds in the morning, and considers, or makes
fun of pretending to consider, as the gifts of the fairy
"Beffana;" for such is the popular conception of
the meaning of the term Epiphany! Now see of how
mighty a wallet is the poor child's stocking the
dwindled representative. The enormous expense of
the wedding preparations made a few "Beffana"
presents especially welcome to the young prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Alphonso at the Epiphany tide of 1502. So at nightfall
he rode forth accompanied by twenty–five horsemen,
with drums and trumpets, and went through the
city "per la sua ventura," in quest of fortune, or, as
we might say, to see what luck would send him. "And
he got for his fairing, 'di sua ventura,' three hundred
head of oxen, an equal number of large cheeses, upwards
of a thousand couple of capons, and other
things to the estimated value of a thousand ducats."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BEFFANA.</div>

<p>In truth, the Beffana was something like a good
fairy in the good old times, especially when a gallant
young prince sought her favour!</p>

<p>But the Beffana could not supply all that was
needed. For on the following Sunday came out the
list of appointments to offices for the year. "And
every man in the list paid for his place through the
nose." Bonifacio Ariosto and Battista di Zilioli,
among others, paid an immense sum for the post of
commissioners of customs. And Tito Strozzi, the
Latin poet, was continued in his place of judge, to the
great discontent of all the people, "but it cost him
very dear."</p>

<p>Besides all this, the ducal palace was open to all
loyal subjects, who came with anything eatable or
drinkable to assist their sovereign in the coming
tremendous call on his hospitality. It was counted
that up to the evening of the 27th, among other
things, fifteen thousand head of poultry had been
brought in as presents. Indeed the zeal of the
Ferrarese outran the necessity of the case, great as
it was; for a few days later we find that a large quantity
of game and poultry had to be thrown into the Po,
because it had become unusable.</p>

<p>From the 25th to the end of the month, all Ferrara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
was hard at work adorning the streets, levelling places
that were uneven, putting up scaffolding for seats
where the bride would pass on her entry, preparing
accommodation for the five thousand three hundred
horses which were expected, contriving as far as possible
means of lodging the "incredible number" of strangers,
who were continually arriving to witness the festival;
putting new marble steps to the altar in the cathedral;
and, lastly, in erecting over the door of the palace a
blazonry of the Pope's arms, together with those of
the King of France, and those of the most illustrious
House of Este, "with angels and hydras, and other
exquisitely beautiful ornaments."</p>

<p>But a most provoking thing was, that in the midst
of all this bustle we had to send out a party on
horseback to meet a certain French cardinal, who was
coming to Ferrara on his way from the King of France
to the Pope. And they had their ride for nothing,
"for his most reverend lordship determined to stay
the night where he was, because his most reverend
lordship had not got his clothes with him."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A STOLEN VISIT.</div>

<p>At last on the 2nd of February the bride and her
immense cortège, increased by the Duke and the
bridegroom, together with all that was either noble
or learned in Ferrara, who had gone out to meet
them, made their triumphal entry into the city.
Alphonso, whose aversion to the match has been
mentioned, was more than reconciled to his lot by
the sight of the bride,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> whose rare beauty at once
captivated him. She passed the night of the first of
February at a villa outside of the city, in order to
make her ceremonial entry on the following day, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
according to courtly etiquette she was to be duly
presented to her bridegroom with infinite laborious
co–operation of bishops and benedictions, trumpeters,
heralds, court–ushers, and bell–ringers. And doubtless
when the appointed moment came, both the lady and
gentleman performed their part of the show, and made
their first acquaintance with each other in the presence
of assembled Italy with all propriety. But it did so
happen that a certain lynx–eyed "gentleman of the
press," (who was early afoot in the exercise of his
profession on the morning of the great day of the
2nd, picking up stray facts to present them,—if not
all hot to "our readers" at their breakfast tables in a
second edition of the Ferrara Times, yet embedded
fossil–like in the vast strata of Muratori's colossal
folios, to us and all future generations) did see a
figure, whom he perfectly well recognised as the Prince
Alphonso, quietly slipping out from a side entrance of
the villa, which held the bride, and hastening back to
the city to prepare himself for his part in the coming
pageant.</p>

<p>Early it must have been that "our reporter" was
guilty of this professional indiscretion, for both dame
and cavalier had much to do in preparation for their
day's work. She had to dress her head with a cap
and jewels valued at fifteen thousand ducats, and her
feet with sandals worth two thousand. She had to
get on her state dress of gold brocade and black satin,
heavy with such a vast quantity of precious stones
that the value of it was incalculable. Thus accoutred
she had to get upon a white jennet entirely covered
with gold brocade, under a canopy supported by all
the doctors of the University of Ferrara, and manage
him as best she might, despite his starting (duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
chronicled) every time the salvos of cannon were
fired. Last, and by no means probably least, she
had to get her following of ladies of honour stowed
in sixteen carts.</p>

<p>As for Alphonso, he had only to put on a cloak all
of plates of beaten gold, of the value of eight thousand
ducats, and hang chains about his neck to the value
of almost as much more, then to mount his black
charger, and ride forth at the head of all the Ferrarese
nobility.</p>

<p>Then followed Pantagruelian feastings and junketings
for several days; in which the usual order seems
to have been to dance all day, and after the feast at
night, to see "comedies" and "Moresche" or morris
dances. Then there were most extraordinary feats of
rope–dancing. Among others, a certain youth—<i>uno
zovene nominato cingano</i>—probably "zingaro" or the
gypsy, passed along a cord stretched across the
whole <i>piazza</i> of Ferrara, from the summit of the
bishop's residence to the summit of the ducal palace,
frightening all the ladies by pretending to fall when
half way across, and catching himself by hooking
his foot on the cord!</p>

<p>After having narrated all that the Duke's lieges
did for their sovereign on this grand occasion, it
would not be fair to quit the subject, without recording
what the good Duke did for them in return. On
the morning of 23rd, all Ferrara was gladdened by a
proclamation made with sound of trumpet throughout
the city, to the effect that his Highness had obtained
from Pope Alexander, permission for all the subjects
of the Duke of Ferrara to eat eggs and milk on all
days whatsoever, no further dispensation being needed
than that signified by the present proclamation!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE ALPHONSO THE FIRST.</div>

<p>So old Duke Hercules was laid in the family vault
in the early days of 1505, not unlamented by his
people, leaving behind him a favourable old–King–Cole
sort of reputation, as the most junketing cake–and–ale
loving sovereign of his day. But he had pretty well
seen the last of the good cake–and–ale times in Italy,
for many a long year to come. His son Alphonso
had his lot cast in very different days.</p>

<p>Italy begins to be overrun by the troops of the
most Catholic Emperor, and the most Christian King;
and famine and pestilence follow in their wake.
Ferrara is afflicted by both scourges. And we catch
a glimpse<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of the young duke striving at the opening
of his reign to do his duty by his subjects, by starting
off himself in quest of corn. Carrying with him
good store of gold, he takes several of those huge ungainly
vessels, half ship half barge, such as may be still
seen on the rivers and canals of the Delta of the Po,
goes to buy corn in Venice, and returns with his
fleet laden, with wretched stuff indeed, and bought
at an enormous price, but most welcome to starving
Ferrara.</p>

<p>Then comes the pestilence, against which no ducal
treasures avail aught. Such general provisions, as
fear and the rude science of the time dictate, are
enforced. Infected houses are shut up absolutely,—none
permitted to enter or come out from them. The
great convent of Franciscans is thus closed upon its
wretched inmates. The University is shut up; and
all tribunals of whatsoever kind suspend their business.
But in five months the deaths amount to six
thousand; while other four thousand have saved themselves
by flight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>But these are only the beginnings of misfortune.
That terrible and indomitable old man, Julius II.,
was on the papal throne;—a pope, who really does
seem to have had some idea of doing his duty as
Heaven's vicegerent on earth, on the theory that this
was most effectually to be accomplished by crying
war to the knife against all who withheld from
St. Peter, dues, titles, or dominions, that should,
could, or might be his. Ferrara occupied a singularly
provocative position on the map to a Holy Father of
this temperament. And what could be easier than
to find at Mother Church's need some flaw to a feudal
title, among the forgotten deeds of ecclesiastical
archives, carefully hoarded, <i>ad hoc</i>. Besides, if there
were nothing else to be said, the Duke makes salt
in the marshes of Comacchio, to the damage of the
apostolical trade in that article; and is therefore
hereby excommunicated, and declared deposed from
his Duchy, and his subjects released from their allegiance!</p>

<p>A very hard struggle had Alphonso to hold his
own against all the spiritual and carnal weapons of
the Church. It must be admitted, that the latter
seem to have troubled him by far the most. And
more than once it appeared as if he must have been
overwhelmed by the superiority of the force against
him. But partly by his own military talents, partly
by the aid of the French, and partly by good fortune,
he won through, till the death of Julius allowed him,
and the rest of the world, a short breathing time of
repose.</p>

<p>Not that his difficulties with Mother Church were
at an end. Leo X., though as mild a mannered Pope
as ever launched a curse, had no intention of abandoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
all the Church's claims on a vassal in disgrace.
He relieved him from the excommunication, and
permitted him to hold Ferrara, but still maintained
a claim on Modena, and made good his hold on that
city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCREZIA'S LATTER DAYS.</div>

<p>In 1519, Alphonso lost, and as it would seem,
bitterly regretted, his wife Lucrezia. "Her husband
and his subjects," writes Frizzi,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> "all loved her for
her gracious manners and for her piety, to which,"
as Giovio says, "having long before abandoned all
worldly vanities, she wholly dedicated herself. She
used to spend the morning in prayer; and in the
evening, would invite the ladies of Ferrara to embroidery–working
parties, in which accomplishment
she greatly excelled. Her liberality to the poor, and
to men of letters, which generally means one and
the same thing," says Frizzi, "was especially notable."</p>

<p>Clement VII., if not so terrible an adversary as
Julius II., was one quite as difficult to deal with.
Promises made only to delude, negotiations entered
on with no intention that they should lead to anything,
treaties made only to be broken, a dexterous playing
off of one potentate against another,—these were the
arts by which Clement sought to steer his devious
and trimming course among the difficulties of the
time; and which at last landed him a prisoner in his
own fortress of St. Angelo, while his and the world's
capital was being sacked beneath his eyes. In this
predicament Clement had by his duly authorised
representative, Cardinal Cibo, in consideration of
Alphonso's joining the French King in a league
against the Emperor, conceded all the points in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
dispute between them. The investiture of Ferrara
was to be renewed and confirmed; all claim of the
Apostolic See to Modena, Reggio, &amp;c., was to be
abandoned; Ippolito the Duke's second son was to
have a Cardinal's hat and the bishopric of Modena;
and Alphonso was to make as much salt at Comacchio
as he pleased.</p>

<p>But hardly was the treaty signed before the Pope
escaped from St. Angelo to Orvieto, and thereupon
unblushingly refused to perform any one of the promises
made. And Alphonso, who had incurred great
risk of the Emperor's displeasure by performing his
share of the bargain, had to turn about with all
possible speed, break with the King of France, and
hope by humble excuses to be able to make it up
again with Charles.</p>

<p>Thus in Ferrara, as indeed throughout Italy, things
were very different from what they had been during
the latter half of the fifteenth century. Men might
with some show of reason talk of the good old times,
and look out on those around them with misgiving
and despondency. And yet the Phœnix was burning
herself as usual; only, as must be admitted, with
more than ordinary amount of pestilential stench and
stifling smoke,—smoke so stifling, so pestilential, that
but few of those, who had to draw their life–breath,
as best they might, in the midst of it, attained to any
remotest guess that all this so sulphureous smother,
and confused darkness of the air, was in truth but
caused by that Phœnix burning, and preparatory
for a purer atmosphere when it was accomplished.
Few in any age can gain such Pisgah–glimpse of the
coming time; fewest in that of which this writing
treats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WORLD IN HER DAY.</div>

<p>But of those few our Olympia, as it is hoped the
reader will see reason to believe, was one. Yet that
terrible burning time,—such a Phœnix burning as
the world has once and once only seen since—was
but on the eve of beginning in the scene on which
Olympia had to appear, at the time of her appearance.
Her mortal career had to be passed in the
midst of the very densest smoke–clouds of the funeral
pyre.</p>

<p>Easy for us, looking back over the traversed maze
with chart in hand, to understand the plan of it!
Easy enough to talk of renaissance and glorious

in the thick of the sweltering struggle, it was as the

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">Troublous new times in Ferrara—How a French King's daughter
became a Duchess—Bygones were aught but bygones—and Mitre
and Cowl were lords of all.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Previously to this celebrated era of "renaissance,"
all the business of education, such as it was, had necessarily
been in the hands of the clergy. But the well–known
circumstances which at the beginning of the
sixteenth century led to a new zeal for the study of the
languages of ancient Greece and Home, led also to the
creation of a totally new class of teachers. The most
eminent professors of the new learning were men,
whose position made it necessary that their acquirements
should be made a means of gaining a livelihood.
And they became therefore for the most part professional
teachers. They were also generally laymen.
A body of lay pedagogues was a new thing in the
world; and surely one of no small significance. For
though these men professed simply to give instruction
in the Greek or in the Latin tongue and literature,
not to educate their pupils, yet the mass of idea,
unstamped by the ecclesiastical mint, which was
necessarily thus circulated, must have exercised an
influence, which has perhaps not been estimated at
its worth, in inquiries into the causes of the mental
tendencies of that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PEREGRINO MORATO.</div>

<p>Among the number of learned laymen, thus independently
exercising the profession of teacher, we find
a certain Peregrino or Pellegrino Morato, a native of
Mantua, established at Ferrara early in the sixteenth
century. He had, we are told, many of the nobility of
Ferrara for his pupils; and had already acquired
considerable reputation by his teaching in several
cities of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> All that has reached us concerning
him concurs to produce the impression that Morato
must have been an estimable and worthy man; among
which testimonies may perhaps be reckoned the fact of
his continued poverty, notwithstanding his success as
a teacher, and the lofty position of some among his
pupils.</p>

<p>The most noted scholars and teachers of that age
would seem to have led almost invariably wandering
lives. They are heard of now holding a chair in one
university and now in another, or attached to several
of the princely houses of Italy in succession. And
such appears to have been the early life of Morato.
But at Ferrara he fixed himself more permanently,
and soon anchored himself there in a manner, which
made "La gran Donna del Po," as Tassoni calls that
city, his home, and the centre of all this world's joys
and sorrows for the remainder of his life. There he
married, and became the father of five children, of
whom Olympia appears to have been the eldest.
There also he formed close and durable friendships
with most of the learned men, of whom a remarkable
band were gathered together in the court and university
of Ferrara.</p>

<p>Among these, one of the most notable for his varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
acquirements as well as for the closeness of his intimacy
with Morato, was Celio Calcagnini, who occupied
the chair of "belle lettere" in the university of his
native city. Antiquarian, mathematician, astronomer,
poet, scholar, and critic, Calcagnini was one of the
most encyclopædic men in an age, when students still
dreamed of mastering the "omne scibile." The
numerous letters printed among his works prove his
friendship with Morato to have been of the most
intimate kind. And, if these letters had fortunately
preserved their dates, instead of being printed in a
confused mass, we should have had the means of
ascertaining much more accurately than is now possible,
the leading events of his friend Morato's life.</p>

<p>Alexander Guarini the grammarian, professor in the
university and secretary to the Duke; Giglio Gregorio
Giraldi, one of the most eminent Greek scholars of
his day, a man of vast erudition and the first writer
of any value on the ancient mythology; Bartolomeo
Ricci, the learned but amusingly vain–glorious and
quarrelsome scholar and critic, whose comedy in Italian
prose entitled "the Nurses" is reckoned by Quadrio
among the best in the language, and who was brought
to Ferrara in 1539, on the recommendation of Calcagnini,
to be tutor to Duke Hercules' son Alphonso,
then six years old; the two brothers Chilian and John
Sinapi, Germans, who occupied the chairs of Greek
and Medicine in the University of Ferrara, of whom
the former was Olympia's master, and was regarded
by her as a second father; and lastly, but bound to
Morato and his family by a more intimate and closer
friendship than any of the others enumerated, Celio
Secondo Curione,—all these, with others of similar
tastes and pursuits formed a society, which rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Ferrara at that time perhaps the most attractive and
desirable residence for a scholar, of any city in Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE HERCULES II.'S MARRIAGE.</div>

<p>Another circumstance occurred not many years
after Morato's first establishment in Ferrara, which
very notably contributed to impress a special character
on the learned society there congregated, and
to make that city a rallying point for the free thought,
which was beginning yeast–like to heave the surface of
Italian life.</p>

<p>The difficulties of protecting his dominions from
the encroachments and greed of the Church, which
compelled Alphonso to be continually oscillating between
the friendship of the Emperor, or of the French
King, according to the ever shifting aspects of Italian
affairs, and the preponderance of the danger imminent
from one side or the other, necessitated in 1528 an
alliance with the latter. And with this view a marriage
was arranged between Hercules, who was to
succeed his father Alphonso in the Duchy as second
duke of that name, and Renée, daughter of Louis XII.
Hercules, then just twenty years old, went to Paris,
where the marriage was celebrated on the 28th of
June, 1528, and brought home his bride in the
November of that year.</p>

<p>And now again, as six and twenty years before,
when Alphonso brought his Borgia home, there was
to be a ceremonial entry of the heir apparent's bride.
But times were changed. And Ferrara, both court
and city, had other matters to think of besides gala
processions and festivities. The clergy, and the
university doctors indeed went out to meet her,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
as in duty bound; and the citizens equally as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
duty bound, hung out of their windows their gay–coloured
silk rugs and curtains, as Italians do to
the present day on the occasions when anything royal
or divine has need of such glorification. But we
hear of no preparations for Homeric feasting, nor
of wonderful gold dresses, and dancing all day, and
morris dances at night. The entry of Louis XII.'s
daughter was a very tame affair. And then Renée herself
was a very different person from the splendid Lucrezia,
who captivated all eyes, as she sat superb in black
and gold, on her proudly pacing steed. Renée on the
contrary came in on a litter; for "this one was by no
means handsome, as were the two Duchesses, who
preceded her. On the contrary she was, according to
a MS. record of that period, somewhat crooked. But
this was compensated by her elevated mind, her
intellect, her literary culture, and her great partiality
for learned men."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Alas! Poor Renée must have valued these good
gifts far more highly than even those of her sex most
rich in such are wont to do, if she would not in her
own heart have bitterly denied the value of any such
compensation! Lucrezia with a dower of infamy
"compensated" by beauty, became the happy wife of
an affectionate husband. Renée with her store of
virtues, and rich intellectual qualities, found but a
state prison, heart–ache, and an unloving lord in this
exile from her native France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTRASTED FORTUNES.</div>

<p>And then that "elevated intelligence," which was to
compensate for crookedness, was but little likely to
contribute to the happiness of one in the position of
Renée of France at the court of Ferrara. Elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
intelligence was a dangerous commodity just about
that time in Italy! For we have already seen the
tendency of men's minds in those days to think of
things that it was far better not to think about at all;
a tendency which it very soon became necessary to
extinguish and trample out at whatever cost. Thus
we find that Renée, not content with having studied
"the learned tongues, history, literature, philosophy,
mathematics, and even astrology," and "unable to
bridle her fervid intellect, gave herself over to the
study of theology, and to complete her misfortune
selected for her instructor one of the most celebrated of
the new–fangled teachers who then infested Europe,"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
no other than one John Calvin. And the result was,
that, whereas the beautiful and catholic Lucrezia
was able,—juvenile indiscretions and ardour of pulse
happily moderated and past—to spend her mornings
in orthodox devotion performed <i>secundum artem</i>, and
her evenings in embroidery, to such purpose as to
have secured the good word of Popes, Cardinals,
Bishops, and learned Doctors, and the final general
approval of Mnemosyne in her official surplice and
rochet,—poor Duchess Renée with her "elevated
intellect," and unhappy improprieties in the matter
of theological inquiry, is marked as a moral leper by
the same consistent ecclesiastical Muse, and finally
consigned to a worse limbo than that of their own
sulphureous pages.</p>

<p>But it is not to be supposed that Renée came to
her husband's court branded as a heretic; though
we find that she forthwith established in her own
apartments "a literary academy," or meeting of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of letters, which, we are told,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> was "much for the
honour of literature, but not at all for that of the catholic
religion." Nor, though almost all of those learned
men, whom she patronised, turned out later to be, as
the historian says, tarred with the same brush, was the
delicate orthodoxy of her husband Hercules offended
by any ill savour of heresy at that time. For the
Church–in–danger alarm bell had not yet rung in Italy.
Clement VII. having quite enough to do to hold his
own among the clashing of the perfectly material
interests of quite satisfactorily catholic, but very
unscrupulous princes, thought of nothing less than
the smelling out of traces of heretical taint. And it
needed something more appreciable by the ducal mind
than speculations about justification by faith to stimulate
its orthodoxy into activity.</p>

<p>So the Duchess for years after her marriage
gathered around her the best minds in her little
capital, and talked her own talk with them, unmolested
and unsuspected.</p>

<p>Nor can it be concluded that Morato was not at this
time imbued with the new opinions, from the fact, that
he evidently stood well in the court society at Ferrara.
In the absence of all ascertained dates to enable us to
fix with precision the leading events of his life, we
must content ourselves with concluding, that it must
have been between the years 1520 and 1525, in all
probability, that he first established himself in that
city. We know that he there married a Ferrarese lady,
and that his daughter Olympia was born there in 1526.
Now it is clear from the letters of Calcagnini that he
must about that time have adopted at least those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
doctrines on justification by faith, and on free–will,
which a few years afterwards were stamped as heretical
and visited with persecution. But nobody on the
southern side of the Alps dreamed as yet that such
opinions, must, or even might, lead to that dreaded
consummation, separation from the Church. Morato
was at this time a valued member of the learned
society of Ferrara; and though doubtless a frequenter
of those academic meetings in the apartments of the
Duchess, which were afterwards discovered to have been
so heretically pernicious, he was as yet well esteemed
by the most unsuspectedly orthodox churchmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANECDOTE OF BEMBO.</div>

<p>A little anecdote from the vast repertory of such
supplied by the "quarrels of authors," may serve to
show that the favourable opinion of Messer Peregrino
Morato was no little valued among the set with whom
he lived. The celebrated Pietro Bembo, who was a
few years after this time called to the purple by Paul
III., had passed some years at Ferrara in the early
part of his life, and having formed friendships with
most of the literary men there, never lost an opportunity
of paying them a visit, and was thus intimate
with all the knot among whom Morato lived. Now it
seems that Bernardo Tasso, the father of the poet,
who was secretary to the Duchess Renée, had somewhat
maliciously written to Bembo that Morato had
accused<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> him of plagiarising certain grammatical speculations,
from one Francesco Fortunio. Upon which
Bembo, writing in reply on the 27th May, 1529,
manifests great anxiety to convince Morato that he
is in error. "On the contrary," writes Bembo, "he
stole these things from me, together with the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
words as I had written them in a small work of mine
before he could speak, much less write, badly as he
does it. This work of mine he saw and had in his
hands many days; and I am ready to show it to him
(Morato) whenever he please; and he will then see
whether I deserve to be thus branded and cut up by
him. Besides, I can introduce him to several great
personages worthy of all credit, who heard and learned
from me all the matters in question, long before
Fortunio took to teaching others what he does not
know himself."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Bembo, ex–secretary to Pope Leo,
and presently to be a Cardinal, stood very much higher
in the social scale than the poor Ferrara schoolmaster;
and would probably have cared for his mistaken accusation
as little as for the obscure Fortunio's plagiarism,
had not his standing in the world of letters given a
very different value to his opinion.</p>

<p>Olympia thus passed the first seven years of her
life in the tranquil prosperity of a humble home,
maintained by the successful labour of its owner, and
cheered by the intimate society of congenial friends.
That the precocious child had already attracted the
notice of the grave and learned seniors who frequented
her father's house, is indicated by a passage in a letter
from Calcagnini to Morato, when absent from Ferrara,
bidding him "to kiss for him the little Muse, whose
prattle was already so charming." And at a later date,
when writing to her, and recalling his remembrances of
her infancy, he says, that the language of the Muses
was her earliest mother tongue, "which she had imbibed
together with the milk from the breast."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">EXILE.</div>

<p>The absence of Morato from Ferrara, which gave
rise to the former of these letters, occurred in 1533.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
That it was involuntary, and regarded by him and his
friends as a great misfortune, is certain. It is tolerably
clear, also, that it was caused by the will of the Duke.
But beyond this we know nothing. Tiraboschi supposed,
with a confusion of dates and events, common
to most of the Romanist writers, who ever seem to
imagine that heresy was always heresy, the same in
1533 as in 1553, that he was exiled for the heterodoxy
of his religious opinions. But that historian admits,
that he afterwards saw reason to change his opinion on
this point.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may have been the cause of a removal,
which the nature of Morato's connection with Ferrara
make him feel as an expatriation, it is certain that it
lasted for six years,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>—the six years that carried
Olympia from seven to thirteen years of age, a period
in the life of a girl of the southern blood on the sunny
side of the Alps, which may probably be equivalent to
that included between the tenth and sixteenth year of
a child of our more tardily developed race.</p>

<p>The nature of her home in Ferrara, and of the
influences that surrounded it, have been indicated.
But of those which had the forming of her character
during these important years of exile, we know nothing.
And Olympia's biographers, in dwelling on her progress
under the eyes of her father's learned friends at
Ferrara, and attributing to them, in great measure, the
truly remarkable degree of classical scholarship to
which she attained, seem to have too much forgotten
the importance of this period, when she was withdrawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
from their instructions. The force of this will be more
apparent, when we come to see the extent of her
attainments at the time of her return, in her thirteenth
year.</p>

<p>It is to the struggling father that this triumph of
pedagogue workmanship must be chiefly ascribed.
That these six years were years of difficulty and
struggle to the poor scholar, who had to turn his
classical lore into bread for his wife and increasing
family, is sufficiently indicated by the wandering nature
of the life in which they were passed. From Venice
to Vicenza, and from Vicenza to Cesena,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> the poor
pedlar pedagogue had to hawk his learned wares, and
drive a very uphill trade. For though learning in
many cases enriched its professors in those days in
such sort as might excite the envy of their successors
in our own, this was always the result of princely
patronage. That Jenkins in Belgrave Square received
more than the value of a curacy is small comfort to
starving flunkies out of place. Between living in clover
as the retainer of some lay or ecclesiastical grandee,
and finding it very difficult to live at all, there can
have been hardly any middle path for a sixteenth–century
scholar, whose erudition was his patrimony. And
then again, though the poor scholar was a character
well enough known through Europe from the twelfth
to the sixteenth century, a poor scholar with a wife
and family was a modern anomaly in 1533. And such
incumbrances fatally put him out of the way of profiting
by any of those small aids which the charities of that
day, in accordance with its modes of life, afforded
towards keeping together the body and soul of many
an indigent "clerk."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">CELIO CURIONE.</div>

<p>But through all the vicissitudes of these hard six
years, Morato pursued unflinchingly the dear object of
his heart, to make his Olympia—the apple of his eye,
whose precocious talents had already awakened all the
pride and ambition of the pedagogue father's bosom—a
perfect specimen of classical training.</p>

<p>Among the towns visited by Morato during these
years of exile, was Vercelli, in Piedmont; and there he
formed a friendship with one who was destined to exercise
an important influence over his future life and that
of Olympia. This was Celio Secondo Curione, whose
acts of overt dissidence from the Church had even then
made him an object of persecution. Having become
wholly alienated from Rome by the study of the Bible,
and of certain of the writings of Melancthon, he was
about escaping into Germany, when he was arrested,
and thrown into prison by the Bishop of Ivrea. At
the intercession of a relative, he was released, on condition
of entering a monastery. There he finally
made the breach between himself and the Church
irreparable, by an act of audacity, which seems to
have been more calculated to produce a theatrical and
epigrammatic effect, than to bring about any useful
result. Having quietly one day removed the relics
from the high altar of the convent church, he installed
the Bible in their place; thus indicating, more significantly
probably than he intended, the tendency of the
new Church then springing into existence, to substitute
a new idolatry, less gross perhaps than that which it
strove to supplant, but equally destined to impede for
long ages the progress of mankind to a higher and
purer theology.</p>

<p>Having fled to escape the consequences of this
daring practical protest, he committed, in Milan, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
1530, the yet more unpardonable outrage of marrying
a wife. Being by this act finally cast adrift upon the
world, with increased responsibilities and necessities,
he sought to obtain wherewithal to live, by publicly
teaching the learned languages and literature. He did
this with such success, as to attain not only that, but
a very wide–spread reputation also, under circumstances
which made obscurity most desirable for his
safety. Driven, accordingly, from his occupation by
the pursuit of his enemies, and yielding to a strong
desire to revisit his native Piedmont, he appears, while
travelling in that direction, to have fallen in with
Morato at Vercelli, and to have been received by his
brother exile and scholar in his temporary dwelling.</p>

<p>They did not part till there had been time for a
friendship of the most intimate kind to spring up
between them. And though, doubtless, there was
plenty of congenial conversation between them on
topics of classical lore,—on the disputed authenticity
of Cicero's rhetoric, or the right interpretation of a
passage of Plato,—we may be very sure, that the talk
which most served to bind them to each other was on
far more burning questions; on subjects which it was
dangerous to touch, but which it had already become
impossible for their minds to leave unprobed,—subjects,
in speaking of which, either felt in his heart,
that each cautious word, that moved a beam of doctrine
but a hair's–breadth, might bring down a whole superincumbent
fabric of venerated creed–edifice in ruin;
subjects, too, in the discussion of which, the man who
poured light into his neighbour's mind, was thereby
exposing him to danger in life and goods,—a danger
proportioned to the temperament of the mind enlightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST RELIGIOUS IMPRESSIONS.</div>

<p>Morato was, it would seem, not formed in the martyr's
mould. There is no reason to suspect him
of hypocritical compliances or tergiversation. But
there are some men, in whom truth so works, that it
cannot lie hidden and dormant, who, despite all pains
and penalties, must needs testify to it, and publish it.
Of such, as has abundantly been seen, was Celio
Curione. That Morato shared his convictions is certain.
But he lived and died in peace in the city of
his adoption.</p>

<p>But there was a third mind there present at these
pregnant conversations, vivid, impressionable, unforgetting,
and cast, as appeared, when it reached its
maturity, in the true heroic mould. And though the
seeds that then fell, unheeded, probably, by the sower,
on Olympia's young intellect, do not appear to have
produced immediate fruit of any kind, unless, indeed,
we trace their consequences in a total absence of all
respect for the orthodox superstitions, they were assuredly
thrown on soil which received and treasured
them.</p>

<p>The two scholars parted. Curione in Piedmont soon
found that the hostility of his family, outraged by his
heretical manifestations, was such as to make it necessary
for him to seek safety in obscurity. And this he
succeeded in finding as tutor to the children of a nobleman,
who lived in the country, near Turin. Here,
however, his zeal for the truth did not allow him long rest
for the sole of his foot. For chancing once to be present
while an itinerant Dominican was preaching in a neighbouring
church, and hearing him falsify in the course
of his sermon some extracts from the writings of some
of the German reformers, he publicly interrupted him
to correct his statement. Seizure, imprisonment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the dungeons of the neighbouring city of Turin, with
the prospect of a trial before the ecclesiastical authorities,
which would be sure to end in a capital condemnation,
were the results, as might have been anticipated,
of this audacious testimony to the truth. Having, by
almost miraculous good fortune, succeeded in escaping
from his prison, he fled to Pavia, and there obtained a
chair in the University.</p>

<p>The decree of the Senate of that city, conferring on
him this employment, is dated 9th of October, 1538.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
And that such a body should have made such an
appointment, just after the candidate for it had escaped
from imprisonment for heresy in a neighbouring city,
is a curious instance of the utter severance in all
respects of one community from another, which a few
miles of intervening territory could in those days effect.
It having been soon discovered, however, adds Tiraboschi,
who the new professor was, he would have been
arrested, if his pupils, already appreciating their teacher
at his worth, had not formed themselves into a bodyguard
for him, which for three years ensured his safety
despite the efforts of the ecclesiastical authorities to get
possession of his person. And here we have another
very remarkable indication of the strange looseness of
the bonds which held society together at that period;
and also, as it may be fairly argued, of the general
reluctance of the Italians to accept these first manifestations
of inquisitorial action, or to lend them, if it
could possibly be avoided, the assistance of the secular
arm. At length, however, urgent representations from
Rome to the government of Milan compelled the University
senate of Pavia to advise Curione to escape
from their city, while it was yet possible to do so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">CURIONE'S STORY.</div>

<p>He was thus thrown once again upon the wide world.
And it was then that his friend Morato, who had by
that time been restored to his home and position at
Ferrara, wrote to him to offer him an asylum under his
own roof.</p>

<p>"Come to us;" writes the Ferrarese pedagogue to
his fellow–labourer; "you will find your place at our
hearth vacant. And especially there is a corner for
you in my library, where you may indulge <i>ad libitum</i>
in the united blessings of solitude, silence, peace, and
oblivion."</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, that the persecuted scholar
quitted these good things occasionally to share in those
meetings in the apartments of Duchess Renée, which
were found to be so pernicious to the true religion. It
was by her, that he was eventually sent with pressing
recommendations to the republic of Lucca, which city
was from the first one of the strongholds of the
"novatori," as the Catholic historians love to style the
Reformers. The Luchesi at once provided him with
a professor's chair in their schools. But he had hardly
been there a year when there came a demand that he
should be given up into the hands of the Pope's officers.
This the free republicans refused to do. But they
judged it prudent to advise him to fly. And as it was
now clear that there was neither safety nor rest for him
in Italy, he determined on abandoning it; and escaping
first to Lausanne, where he taught with credit and
success for four years, was thence invited by the city of
Bâle to accept the chair of literature in that University;
where he remained leading a life of peaceful and useful
literary labour till his death in 1569.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
works left by him, which may be found catalogued by
Schelhorn in his "Amænities," are some of them on
theological subjects, but chiefly treat of classical criticism
and grammar.</p>

<p>Morato had returned to Ferrara. His wanderings
were brought to an end by the permission to do so in
1539. His colleagues, friends, and pupils had never
ceased to regret his absence. Calcagnini had written
to him in his exile, assuring him that "every one
confesses how great a loss the city has suffered by your
departure," and that his scholars refused to attend the
lectures of any other professor.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Whatever may have
been the cause of his exile, it is evident that no prejudice
against him existed at the court on his return.
When he left Ferrara in 1533, Alphonso I. was still
reigning. He died in 1534; and Morato on his return
found Hercules II. and his wife Renée on the throne.
And very shortly after this restoration to his home and
his pupils he was appointed tutor to the late Duke's
two sons, Alphonso and Alphonsino.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MORATO'S RETURN.</div>

<p>Now, therefore, all was once again well with our
professor. His old friends hastened to gather round
him, and found in his modest home a new attraction, in
addition to those which had previously rendered his
society precious to them. Old Calcagnini found the
"prattling infant muse" to whom he had sent a kiss in
her exile, grown into a lovely girl, on the eve of blossoming
into womanhood, with talents and acquirements
sufficient to make the reputation of a mature scholar.
In truth, the apparition among them of this bright–eyed
and bright–minded creature, enthusiastic in her love for
that literature which had been the object and business
of their lives, animated with the very spirit of the poesy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of Greece and Rome, eloquent with the well–loved
music of Homer's or Virgil's tones, which fell mended
from her lips, talking their talk, interested in their
discussions, and anxious to learn more of all, that it
was so delightful a task to them to teach, seems nearly
to have turned the learned heads of that knot of grey–beards,
who frequented her father's house. They seem
at a loss how to express their admiration in terms sufficiently
glowing. Old Gregory Giraldi, writing amid
the tortures of the gout, which kept him bed–ridden
during the last ten years of his life, speaks of her as
"a damsel talented beyond the nature of her sex,
thoroughly skilled in Greek and Latin literature, and a
miracle to all who hear her." Comparisons with
Diotima, Aspasia, the Muses, Graces, and everything
feminine that ever was wise, brilliant, or charming, were
showered around her. If it be possible that the head of
a youthful beauty should be turned by the flattery and
admiration of grey–headed and gouty old gentlemen,
expressed in the most Attic Greek, and purest Ciceronian
Latin, that of Olympia could hardly have escaped.</p>

<p>This chorus of admiration must, at all events, have
been gratifying to the proud father. The home–coming,
after his long wanderings, must have been a happy one.
His appointment at the court, too, must have been a
satisfactory assurance that no suspicion of heterodoxy
had as yet arisen to injure him. Yet mischief from this
source had been busy in Ferrara during his absence,
and that in the innermost chambers of the palace.
The priest had, as usual, thrust himself between
the husband and the wife; and the Duchess Renée
had become, on theological grounds, an object of
suspicion to her husband, whose political relations
with the Holy See made it expedient that he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
his should enjoy a reputation of unblemished orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Renée had, years before, as we have seen, consorted
with those who were <i>afterwards</i> found to have been
enemies to the Church; and she must have been known
to have held, ever since her first coming into Italy,
doctrines which were <i>afterwards</i> pronounced heretical.
But so did Contarini, who was sent by the Pope to
Ratisbon in 1541 to hold conference, and, if possible,
come to accord with the Protestants. Meantime
nobody knew exactly how the Church might peremptorily
require her sons to believe themselves justified.
And Duke Hercules was by no means likely to have
any special personal susceptibilities on such matters.
So, as long as no offence was given to Rome, Renée
might hold her "academies," gather her spiritual
friends around her, and talk about faith and works, if
she liked it.</p>

<p>But during Morato's absence events had happened
which had changed all this. One M. Charles d'Espeville
had arrived at Ferrara in 1536. The good
Duchess, always eager to welcome, and assist if need
were, her countrymen, accorded the most hospitable
reception to this M. d'Espeville. He at once became
one of her intimates, and was admitted to conferences
either secret, or shared only with a select few.</p>

<p>Now if lay sovereigns have, as has been said, long
arms, Mother Church has a piercing and most ubiquitous
eye. Though Duke Hercules might not see what
was passing under his nose, vigilant Mother Church saw
it, as she sat far away in the middle of her spider's web
there at Rome. And she hastened to hiss into the ear
of Duke Hercules the horror, that there in his city of
Ferrara, in the innermost chambers of his own palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in the closet of his wife, was crouched, hatching heresies
and treasons, the arch–heretic, the very emissary
of the Evil one, Calvin himself!<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SPIRITUALITIES AND TEMPORALITIES.</div>

<p>These, it must be admitted, were tidings of a sort to
irritate a ducal husband, troubled little about his "justification,"
but much about his investiture parchments;—most
orthodoxly willing to be saved either by works
or faith, or any other way Holy Church might deem
best for him; but extremely anxious about his "tail
male," and the securing of his temporalities against
the strangely temporal appetites of that spiritual
mother. For of all the long disputes between Duke
Hercules and the Apostolic chamber, painfully prosecuted
by envoys, memorials, writings innumerable, by
even personal riding to Rome, and heart–wearying
struggle with the obstructions, insincerities and chicaneries
of that most intolerable of human entities,
the gist was briefly this. My body, with its ducal cloak
and trappings, its dignities, possessions, and hereditaments
to be mine, and the same to pass to the heirs
thereof lawfully begotten;—my soul, with all thereunto
appertaining,—of course carrying with it <i>sans mot dire</i>,
the souls of all my subjects,—to be yours in eternal
fee simple, to fashion, manage, and dispose of as to you
shall seem fit. A fair bargain surely this, proposed
by Duke Hercules of Ferrara, by no means a singular
or eccentric prince, if indeed souls were what Mother
Church was specially eager after, as she said! And
this agreement might have been quickly and easily
made, to be loyally observed by either party, as agreements
between honest folk are, had it not been that
Holy Mother Church, fully minded to keep tight hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of the souls in question, would not give up the hope of
laying her hand on the bodies also.</p>

<p>And now in the midst of all the uphill work of driving
his negotiation to a favourable conclusion, as he
hoped, while promising largely, and most sincerely,
poor man! the complete cession of his own and subjects'
souls, here was his own wife, not only saying her
soul was her own, but disposing of it to Mother Church's
most dreaded and detested enemy.</p>

<p>Swift remedy found the exasperated Duke for such
domestic treason. And here Mnemosyne begs to suggest
as a subject for artistic presentment the incident
which followed. Scene—the private closet of the
Duchess in the castle of Ferrara. The persons assembled
there have been engaged in that sweet converse so
delightful to persons bound together by common
thoughts and feelings in the midst of an unsympathising
and hostile world around them. There is the good
Duchess, who has perhaps been mingling with more
serious discourse questionings of things in that dear
distant France, which she never ceased while absent
from it to regret. The elderly lady, somewhat austerely
dressed in black to the throat, with deep ruffle
around her neck, and large hanging sleeves to her
dress, is Madame de Soubise, who came with Renée
from France, and who was, as is well known, "lame of
the same foot," as the Catholic writers phrase it. The
great heresiarch himself might have been recognised
by those handsome but hard and severe features, the
lofty but not noble forehead, and the bright but domineering
eye; but he could not have been known from
habiliments chosen to suit the character of M. Charles
d'Espeville. The Signeurs de Pons and de Soubise
may also have been present. But one other person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
was assuredly there;—a writer of obscene French
verses, as the orthodox Italians call him,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who had an
absurd mania for meddling in theology, and fancying
that he comprehended the original language of the
sacred writers, one Clement Marot,—he was there too,
and "assisted Calvin much in saturating the mind of
the Duchess with pestilent doctrine."</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUCHESS RENÉE IN A SCRAPE.</div>

<p>"To them, enter" hurriedly and noisily the Duke
in high wrath, and at his heels, opera–stage fashion, a
sufficient impersonation of "la force publique."</p>

<p>A rapid glance of the angry eye indicates to those
active officers the duty in hand. And M. Charles
d'Espeville, alias John Calvin, and the luckless poet
turned theologian, are marched off, with a very tolerable
prospect of martyrdom before them. "And as for you,
Madame! ... &amp;c."</p>

<p>Calvin and Marot were marched off under escort to
Bologna. But the terrible marital lecture, which it
has been left to the competent reader's imagination
to supply, did not so terrify Renée as to prevent
her from promptly and secretly dispatching certain
trustworthy emissaries, who, overtaking the escort
on their road,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> liberated the prisoners, and set
them free to make the best of their way across the
Alps.</p>

<p class="b1">This incident made a serious difference in the
condition of the Duchess. Constant suspicion and
severity seem to have henceforth made her life at
Ferrara a very unhappy one. And the following lines<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
addressed by Clement Marot to Marguerite, the sister
of Francis I., speak touchingly enough the forlorn
misery of her life:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p class="psq20">"Ah, Marguerite! list to the bitter smart,<br />
That fills Renée of France her noble heart;<br />
And sisterlike some better aid impart</p>
<p class="ps30">Than hope alone.</p>
<p class="psi20">Thou knowest how she left her native shore,<br />
Leaving there friends and kin for evermore;<br />
But what in that strange land she doth endure</p>
<p class="ps30">Thou dost <i>not</i> know.</p>
<p class="psi20">She sees not one, to whom she can complain;<br />
Her bright eye seeks her distant land in vain;<br />
And, as to quench all hope, the mountain chain</p>
<p class="ps30">Parts her and you."</p>

<p class="p1">Renée was henceforward a person marked as "infected,"
and subjected to suspicion and severity accordingly;
not because she held certain opinions, which, as
has been before insisted on, were not yet condemned;
but because she had been discovered to be the disciple
and friend of Calvin. He at all events was condemned
clearly enough; and to consort with him was overt
heresy. And this happened in 1536. It is impossible
to suppose, therefore, that Morato could have continued
in the good graces of the court, had he been known to
harbour beneath his roof a fugitive from the ecclesiastical
authorities, as Celio Curione was in 1541, which
must have been the epoch of his visit to Ferrara.
Nor could the Duchess have ventured, unless in strict
secrecy, to have received him, and sent him with her
recommendations to Lucca.</p>

<p>The palace of Ferrara was thus at this time essentially
divided against itself. The Duke and the Duchess
were pulling with might and main in diametrically
opposite directions; he by open exercise of authority,
every now and then irritated into violence: she by dissimulation
and secret intelligences.</p>

<p>And this was the state of that household, not pleasing
in any home however royal, when our Olympia was
called to become a member of it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">How shall a Pope be saved? with the answer thereto.—How shall our
Olympia be saved? To be taken into consideration in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The eldest child of Hercules and Renée was a
daughter, Anna, born in 1531. Alphonso, the heir
apparent, who succeeded to the Duchy in 1559, was
born in 1533. Then came another daughter, Lucrezia,
born in 1535, a third named Eleonora, in 1547, and
lastly a second son, called Luigi, in 1538. Thus
Anna, the eldest, was eight years old at the time of
Morato's return to Ferrara; and her education,
according to the newest fashion then in vogue, was
the chief pre–occupation of the Duchess. The new
learning was the fashionable mania of the day in
ladies' bower, as in the halls of universities. A delicate
taste for the charm of a Ciceronian style was as
much necessary to the finished education of a noble
lady then, as the graceful carriage of the person in
crossing a room or entering a carriage is now. Male
blockheadism had not yet suggested to the prudent
jealousy of the lords of the creation the discovery, that
learning tended to unfit women for the more special
duties of wives and mothers. Not to be classical was
to be nothing. So Anna d'Este was above all else to
be a perfect Latinist and Grecian.</p>

<p>It was in 1540, when she was only nine years old (!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that Calcagnini thus wrote to her, of course in Latin,
only to be known from that of the purest Augustan
mintage by its greater difficulty and a certain affected
intricacy of construction, observable in most of the
Latinists of that period:—</p>

<p>"I have read the fables you have translated from
the Tuscan into Latin, in an elegant and ornate style,
as becomes a royal hand. On finishing the perusal
I had only to regret, that it was so soon ended, and
that my curiosity was left unsatisfied. I trust that
these essays may be the seed of future compositions,
which, when matured, will reflect honour on your
name. I have already the pleasure of applauding
these first steps on the path to fame."</p>

<p>What the very young lady's own composition may
have been we have no means of judging; but it must
be presumed that she was at all events competent to
read readily the letter in which these compliments are
addressed to her; and we should now–a–days consider
that much for a young lady of nine years, or young
gentleman either.</p>

<p>Other translations sent, as it seems, to Celio
Curione in the following year, are acknowledged by
him in still more flattering and flowery language.
And the circumstance is remarkable on other grounds
than as a testimony to the Princess Anna's classical
proficiency. Curione was at that time, as has been
seen, a refugee from ecclesiastical persecution, finding
shelter and concealment in the house of Morato. Is
it to be supposed that Duke Hercules would have
tolerated his daughter's correspondence with one so
situated, and that, too, after the unfortunate Calvin
discovery? It seems to be but too clear, that Miss
Anna and her mamma must have come to the understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
that papa was to know nothing about these
literary intimacies with gentlemen under a cloud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOES TO COURT.</div>

<p>We may be tolerably certain too, that had the Duke
known all that his wife knew of Messer Peregrino
Morato, he would not have permitted another step,
which that lady took about the time of which we are
speaking, very soon after the return of Morato,—that
is, and in all probability not later than 1540. This
was the invitation of Olympia to court, to be the companion
of her daughter, and sharer in her studies.
Renée well knew the power of emulation; and in her
eagerness to stimulate the efforts of her daughter, she
determined to place beside her one, just five years
older than herself, of whose wonderful talents and
acquirements all Ferrara was talking.</p>

<p>So in, or very near about, 1540, Olympia left her
father's humble home and went to be an inmate of
the court, in the dissenting interest, or female side of
the house. For dissension and dispute were ever
more and more openly manifesting themselves in
that splendid dwelling. The Duke and his councillors,
lay and ecclesiastical, were becoming from day to
day more jealously and suspiciously orthodox; as
tidings from all parts of Italy showed that the Church
was becoming alive to the dangers which threatened
it from the new ideas, and, having once realised this
fact, was suddenly convinced of their heretical nature,
and determined to exert its utmost power to extinguish
them by violence.</p>

<p>Paul III., a politic and worldly wise old man, with
considerable desire to do such parts of a Pope's duty
as could be accomplished without interfering with his
own projects and schemes of ambition, was quite as
much minded as any member of the sacred college to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
preserve intact to Rome its bishops and high priests,
the monopoly of those sacerdotal emoluments and
perquisites, which sacramental Christianity was contrived
to afford in abundance. Pius IX., a better
man, as living in better times than Paul III., found
himself in front of the same eternal difficulty. All
hope and project of reform had to be abandoned before
the too–evident incompatibility of the fundamental
sine–quâ–non condition, that "I transmit to my successors
intact the power I have received from my
predecessors." Thorough reform on the condition,
that nothing shall be changed! Poor Pius! So once
again Holy Church had to return to its vomit of St.
Angelo and Paliano prisons, arbitrary arrests, immaculate
conceptions, winking virgins, and concordats.
And mankind finding finally, all hope of curing the
cancer vain, has to screw its courage to the truly painful
and terrible operation of excision;—as mankind
silently and with naturally reluctant procrastination,
is even now doing.</p>

<p>Paul III. was as free from persecuting instincts
as Pius IX. He had been a man of the world, was
the father of children, and had a natural human
heart within his bosom. But at his elbow stood one,
who was all priest. No merciful weakness, no natural
affection, no human sympathy, no shade of misgiving,
ever checked John Peter Caraffa in his crusade against
free human thought. When Paul was doubtfully
deliberating what measures might best be adopted to
check the progress of heresy in Italy, Caraffa promptly
decided for him, that the Inquisition was the one
thing wanted,—the Inquisition with fullest powers of
imprisonment, confiscation, and death, and he himself
as Chief Inquisitor,—this, by God's help, and that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
fire and sword, and nothing else than this, would
succeed in victoriously crushing and extirpating
hydra–headed heresy. On the 21st of July, 1542,
the requisite bull was obtained from Paul III., and
Caraffa rushed to his work, with the avidity of an
unleashed hound on his prey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RENÉE'S TROUBLES.</div>

<p>Such signs of the times were not lost upon Duke
Hercules, and reproduced themselves in sundry painful
forms in the interior of the palace. The Duchess
is still found to have about her persons "of very
unwholesome smell;"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the flock of them have to be
overhauled by the Duke's new Jesuit director, Pelletario,
and all those found "with the rot upon them"
are got rid of. A powerful stream of pure doctrine
was turned on upon the infected Duchess, and sacraments
were prescribed without much success. The
"miserable woman" is found with flesh–meat on her
table on a Friday; and the justly exasperated Duke,
at his wits' end, has to shut her up in her apartment,
with two attendants only, and send her daughters to a
convent. "Now, though Renée was very astute,"
writes the historian, "far more so than the Duke and
all his counsellors, yet it is not permissible to attribute
wholly to her cunning the surprising conversion
that was operated in her, immediately after she was
shut up."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The imprisoned lady, under plainly miraculous
influence, sent suddenly for her husband's
priest, made a full confession, placed her conscience
entirely in his keeping, and asked for the sacrament
from his hands. So efficacious a spiritual agent is a
little persecution, that astute as the patient was, and
temporary as the conversion was proved in the sequel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the historian cannot believe but that some genuine
spiritual effect was produced by it.</p>

<p>It at all events had the effect of releasing Renée
from her durance, and restoring her daughters to her.
For the Duke, delighted at the success of his discipline,
"admitted her to sup with him that same
evening."</p>

<p>But amid all this, in a family so constituted, and
living under such conditions, young Olympia must
have been placed at times in strange positions, have
witnessed some suggestive scenes, and altogether have
had offered to her ripening intelligence matter for
meditation on many things. As to the disputed
points, and antagonistic principles and prejudices,
which lay at the root of all these jars and difficulties,
she seems to have been at that time effectually preserved
against all the dangers of partizanship by
thorough indifference to the whole subject. The
arrangement by which she had become a resident at
the court was to her a subject of unmixed rejoicing
and exultation. The household duties which the
narrow circumstances of her father's home had
imposed upon her, had occasioned many a sigh over
the hours thus lost to her beloved studies. Now her
whole life was to be devoted under the most favourable
circumstances to the prosecution of them. "Henceforward,"
writes Calcagnini in a letter to her, "you
may give yourself up to your favourite pursuits,
change the distaff for the pen, house linen for
books, and the exercise of the fingers for that of
the mind.... It will now be for you to
preserve without flaw the good gifts which you have
received from your parents—modesty, candour, and
virtuous principles, and to add to them wisdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
elegance, high–mindedness, and contempt for all that
is base."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST COMPOSITIONS.</div>

<p>She was, moreover, still to be under the tuition of
her father in the palace, and was to share with the
Princess Anne the Greek lessons of Sinapi.</p>

<p>Several specimens have been preserved of her compositions
about this time, which indicate a very remarkable
amount of acquirement. Various passages have
have been quoted by her biographers with perhaps
more of admiration than they merit. They were
received by her contemporaries with the most unbounded
and hyperbolical applause; and the modern
narrators of her career seem to have taken the tone of
the high–flown eulogies of these productions which they
have found on record. But in reading things of this
kind, of Cisalpine production, much allowance must
always be made for the prevalent habit of undiscriminating
and exaggerated laudation, arising from
the ever–present influence of municipal rivalry. The
"nul aura de l'esprit, hors nous et nos amis,"
principle was always at work. To a Ferrara man,
Olympia was <i>our</i> Olympia,—"gloria Ferraræ; patriæ
decus," &amp;c., and was to be made the most of accordingly.
But, secondly, still more allowance must be
made for the strong tendency of the literary culture of
that period in Italy to regard the form rather than the
matter. Artistic love for the beauties of language leads
the literary world of Italy, even at the present day, to
attach an undue measure of importance to diction and
style, at the expense of subject–matter. And at the
flood–tide of the classical mania of the sixteenth century,
correctness of classic phraseology, and perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of mimicry of the ancients, was the alpha and omega
of excellence.</p>

<p>And in these respects the writings of Olympia are
truly remarkable. The amount of acquaintance with
the classics then most in vogue, the familiarity with
their modes of thinking, and the mastery of their language,
attained by a girl of from fourteen to sixteen,
are really astonishing. Thus we have an essay on
Mutius Scævola in Greek; a defence of Cicero against
some of his detractors; and, more remarkable still,
lectures (!) on the paradoxes of that author.</p>

<p>Of the whole picture, such as we are able to realise
it, of this bright and beautiful Olympia, ambitious of
praise, triumphant, full of fervid poetic enthusiasm,
and love of the beautiful, enchanting all eyes, and
charming all ears,—approaching, one may fancy, in
social position, some Siddons or Mars more nearly
than any other existence known to our times; of the
whole picture, these public lectures, or declamations,
seem to our notions the strangest feature. Let the
inmates of our "Establishments," "Colleges," "Academies,"
of the most finished and "finishing" category,
picture to themselves a young lady of sixteen called on
to lecture before an audience, composed of all the court
circle, and most learned Dons of Ferrara, on the Paradoxes
of Cicero!—improvising her declamation, too, in
Latin and Greek, if we may believe her friend Curio,
writing many years afterwards, with the enthusiastic
admiration of these exhibitions still strong within him.</p>

<p>"Then," writes he, "we used to hear her declaiming
in Latin, improvising in Greek, explaining the paradoxes
of the greatest orators, and answering to all the
questions addressed to her."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">MORATO'S PRECEPTS.</div>

<p>It is evident that these public performances were
considered among the most important and valuable
parts of a complete education, from the instructions
still extant, which Morato gave in writing to his
daughter about the time when she left his roof to
reside under that of Duchess Renée.</p>

<p>Here are some of the admonitions which a fond
and anxious father deemed most important to be impressed
on a daughter about to leave her paternal roof
for the first time.</p>

<p>"A matron, before leaving her bower, consults her
mirror and her favourite maid to know with what look
and air she is about to appear in society. The human
voice ought to act in like manner. A speaker should
use his lips as bridles to his words, raising or lowering
his tones, and giving them delicacy or sonority as he
opens his lips more or less.</p>

<p>"Virgil, Cæsar, Brutus, Cicero, excelled in the art of
elocution. Minerva, Mercury, the Muses, the harmony
of the spheres, the chords of the lyre, Apollo, the king
of song, echo, which repeats our voices,—are not all
these images of the multiplicity of tone of which the
human voice is capable? What man does not listen
with pleasure to accents pure and harmonious? The
guardian of the infernal gate, Cerberus himself, is
appeased by them. The wheel of Ixion at the sound
of a sweet voice stands still!"</p>

<p>Humph! It does not quite please one!—rings
mighty hollow, at least on the Teutonic ear, all this
about Minerva, Mercury, Apollo, king of song, and
the wheel of Ixion! Was that worthy old sixteenth–century
schoolmaster really and truly scooped and
hollowed out by perpetual droppings from Helicon
into an empty shell resounding classicalities, and mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
togaed simulacrum of a Roman of the Augustan age?
To the Teutonic imagination, the picture thus far
realised of our Olympia, seems to present an altogether
scenic personage, prepared for purposes of representation,
slender, graceful figure, draped in long white
muslin robes, with beautifully eloquent upraised arm,
"Andres athenaioi" on her lovely lips, and background
of gleaming marble porticoes, and grey–green olive
groves behind,—the cloudless blue above, and bluer
Egean in the distance! A truly charming picture!
And yet this nineteenth century of ours would be
sorely puzzled to what good use to put the original, if
we had her among us, for any other than mere academic
drawing–school purposes.</p>

<p>Not a principal "in any establishment," of howsoever
slight "finishing" pretensions, but would at once, on
most cursory examination, pronounce our poor Olympia
an entire failure as a specimen of female education, a
mistake from beginning to end, good only as an
example of what should be avoided.</p>

<p>Several of the lectures, or declamations, pronounced
by her before the learned world of Ferrara, have been
preserved. Here is a specimen of the introductory
portion of one of them.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p class="b1">"I well know the rarely equalled benevolence of my
audience; yet the timidity natural to my age, joined to
the feebleness of my talents, fills me with reasonable
alarm. I tremble, and remain voiceless, like the
rhetorician who steps up to the altar at Lyons<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>—</p>

<p class="p1">"However, you command, and I will obey; for no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
sacrifice is more agreeable to God than that of a
willing obedience. I submit myself, therefore, to this
trial for the third time, like an artist unskilled in his
art, who can make nothing of a coarse–grained marble.
But if you offer a block of Parian to his chisel, he will
no longer deem his work valueless. The beauty of the
material will give value to his production. Perhaps it
will be so with mine. There are strains so rich in
melody and harmony, that even when reproduced by the
most miserable instrument, they yet retain all their
charm. Such are the words of my favourite author.
Listen to them. They will lose nothing of their grace
and majesty even in passing from my lips."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PUBLIC DECLAMATION.</div>

<p>Those who were present at those performances
thought that the words gained much, on the contrary,
in passing from those lips. Nothing seems to have
excited the admiration and approbation of her contemporaries
more than these public declamations. "One
might have fancied that one was listening to one of the
learned virgins of Greece or Rome, to whom, indeed,
she may be justly compared!"<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> cries one enthusiastic
hearer.</p>

<p>"The young girls of thy age," writes another,
"pluck spring flowers from the meadows to weave them
into many–coloured chaplets. But thou gatherest no
flowerets doomed ere long to fade and die, but selectest
the immortal amaranths from the abounding gardens of
the Muses, whose altogether divine privilege it is never
more to wither, but gain beauty from time, and flourish
ever more greenly as it passes."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p class="b1">Poor old Giraldi sends her Latin verses from his gout–tormented

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

"Thou'rt all fair and brightly glowest,<br />

Which Renée's fair virgins tread,<br />
And the sister Muses nine.<br />

</p>

<p class="p1">To all this homage was added the affectionate kindness
and liking of the Duchess, Olympia's sovereign
and mistress. She had, apparently after she had been
at the court about a couple of years, an illness which
made it desirable for her to return to her father's house,
though it was with difficulty, we are told,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that Renée
could make up her mind to part with her. Her absence
was not long, and the following letter from the Greek
professor, John Sinapi (he too, be it observed, in passing,
"of very unwholesome smell;" so vain were poor
Duke Hercules' efforts to keep a purely orthodox
household), indicates the high place occupied by
Olympia in the favour of the court.</p>

<p>"All here are greatly delighted to know that you are
re–established and out of the doctor's hands. Settle at
once with your father the day and the manner of your
return among us. The Princess has declared that it
will be a great pleasure to her to see you again, be it
brought about how it may. She places at your disposition
the litter in which you were carried to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
father's house. Only arrange with your father your
return, in whatever manner you may find most agreeable
and speediest."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPOILING.</div>

<p>With her companion and fellow–student, the Princess
Anne, she lived on terms of the most affectionate intimacy.
A durable friendship grew up between them; and
a letter written many years afterwards by Olympia to her
old playmate, gives a pleasing idea of the sort of companionship
which existed between the two young girls.</p>

<p>"You remember," she writes, "how familiarly we
lived together, notwithstanding you were my sovereign
and liege lady, and for how many years the companionship
lasted; how all our studies were in common, and
how the pursuit of them continually increased the
affection which had grown up between us."</p>

<p>Surely here was enough to "spoil" any young lady
in her teens, if homage, flattery, applause, admiration,
excited and gratified vanity, had spoiling power!</p>

<p>And Olympia stepped upon the pedestal set for her
with all the youthful audacity of conscious genius.
They all told her, that she was a tenth muse, and she
accepted the part with exulting confidence, that it was
in truth that for which kind nature had best fitted her.
Hear her own joyous profession of faith, as standing
there in the pride and grace of her beauty before a
courtly, gay, and learned circle, she mouthed it forth
in sonorous Greek verse, harmoniously flowing with the
pure young voice amid a burst of enthusiastic applause,
the echoes of which have sounded across three hundred
years.</p>

<p class="b1">Done into homely English the rhymes fall sadly flat.
But the meaning may correctly be gathered as thus:<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppq20">"No joy is still a joy to all mankind,<br />
For Jove hath given to each a different mind!<br />
Castor and Pollux by a different aim,<br />
Though twin–born brothers, seek the path to fame.<br />
And I, though woman, womanly gear have left,<br />
Distaff and threads, and work–basket and weft!<br />
The Muses' haunts, Parnassus' flowery hill,<br />
These have been all my joy, these shall be still.<br />
For other pleasures other maids have sighed,<br />
These are my glory, these my joy and pride."</p>

<p class="p1">The hexameters and pentameters are quite as good,
and no better, than our English schools, after sufficient
years spent in minutely copying from the model, can
supply, if need were, in any quantity to order.</p>

<p>Poor Olympia! The highly competent principle of
that finishing establishment, to whose experienced
judgment we have already had occasion to refer, would
arch her awful brows more highly than ever over her
gold double eye–glasses, it is to be feared, at these
shockingly unfeminine sentiments, <i>τἁ θηλυκἁ λεϊπον</i>,"
"taken leave of your feminalities"! Miss Morata!
If I am rightly informed of your meaning, unhappily
it would indeed seem so! A very unfortunately situated
young woman! Altogether devoid too of religious
principle, as I am told; and as indeed might have been
guessed without telling!</p>

<p>Not improbably there may have been ladies too in
Ferrara who commented on the young muse much to
the same purpose. But Olympia trod her bright path
exultingly, scattering poesies and gathering triumphs,
serenely indifferent to the justification quarrels, and
free–will perplexities which were distracting the world
around her, serenely worshipping beauty amid her
muse–haunted attic shades in undeniably heathenish
and pagan fashion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEMINALITIES RECOVERABLE.</div>

<p>Poor Olympia! "Malignant fate sate by and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
smiled." But some better ruler of the destinies than
any malignant fate smiled also. The "Theluka" were
after all not left very far behind. They will all be
forthcoming in due time, these saucily abused feminalities,
at the quickening trumpet–blast of the fairy knight
appointed to the adventure of breathing the soul of
womanhood into our Undine–like muse.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">"The whirligig of time brings in his revenges."—Still Undine.—The
"salvation" question stands over.</p>

<p class="pn p2">In the winter of 1542–3 Charles V. was in Italy,
returning from his unsuccessful expedition against
Algiers. As usual, the sovereigns of Italy were all on
the alert to do homage to their great "barbarian"
master; buzzing about him, to beg "investitures,"—to
plead for pardon in respect of deeds done in contempt
of their allegiance as soon as his back was turned,—to
complain one against the other, and in general to kotoo
the great man, and express by all means their own
flunkyhood.</p>

<p>Even octogenarian Paul III. thought it necessary
to travel in mid–winter to meet the Emperor in the
neighbourhood of Bologna. Paul was anxious about
the great council now at last in earnest on the point of
being summoned; was very desirous of sounding the
Emperor's mind, and getting, if possible, at his real
views upon the subject; and thought, perhaps, that
some good might be done by having an opportunity of
ear–wigging him respecting sundry matters connected
with it.</p>

<p>Charles had promised to meet him at Busseto; and
the old Pope had travelled as far as Parma towards the
place of meeting. But the Emperor kept him waiting
there in vain, remaining himself the while in Genoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TIME'S REVENGES.</div>

<p>Very near the spot, where the octogenarian Pope was,
in the depth of winter, awaiting the pleasure of the Emperor,
there had taken place, some five hundred years
before, another meeting between an Emperor and a Pope,
of which the circumstances had been somewhat different.
And it may be supposed that the vicinity of that world–famous
Canossa castle can hardly have failed to suggest
some very disagreeable comparisons to the mind of the
pontiff. Then it had been the Emperor, who had waited
the good pleasure of the priest, standing there for three
days' space bareheaded among the snow. Those were
the good old days, eh, your Holiness! But then, that
grand old Hildebrand, you see, really did think and
believe, without any manner of doubt, that he absolutely
<i>was</i> God's vicar on earth;—in some sense, indeed, truly
was so. And that makes all the difference in the matter.
Whereas your Holiness, in this sixteenth century, you
know, between ourselves ... must put the best
face you can upon the matter, swallow your indignation
as best you may, and turn your face homewards.</p>

<p>Pope Paul did so; and determined on returning to
Bologna by way of Ferrara, very much to the annoyance
of Duke Hercules.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It was not that there was
not plenty of business to be transacted between the
Pope and the Duke. But the successor of St. Peter
travelled in a manner that made the honour of being
his host a very serious consideration. Duke Hercules
was much given to splendid hospitality, was fond, generally,
of magnificence, and of occasions for display.
But he had already borne the entire expense of the
Pope's passage through Modena on his way northwards,
and was not anxious to do the honours of his capital to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
such a visitor on such a scale as he felt he must do
them, if they were to be done at all.</p>

<p>In the first place "Servus servorum" travelled with
a suite of three thousand persons, among whom were
eighteen cardinals, forty bishops, and a whole posse of
ambassadors and princes. He brought with him fourteen
hundred horses, which seem few enough to drag
and carry all these ecclesiastical dignitaries and their
followers over the roads of Italy as they then were.
Then festivals, gala doings temporal and spiritual,
spectacles and celebrations of all sorts must be provided,
and cash disbursed on all sides. A magnificent
state barge,—a bucentaur, as the chroniclers call it,
such as that in which the Venetian doge went out to
wed the Adriatic—was sent up the Po to the nearest
point to Parma, together with a whole fleet of other
boats to bring the Pope and his enormous following
down the river.</p>

<p>The famous villa of Belvidere was to be the Pope's
resting place the first night after entering the Duke's
territories. This was a pleasure–palace of the Dukes
of Ferrara, built on an island in the Po, which was
entirely occupied by it and the superb gardens attached
to it. The recorders of the Ferrarese magnificences
are never tired of describing the splendours of Belvidere,
its marble quays and stairs from the water's edge,
its courts, its fountains (which necessarily, as Frizzi
remarks, must have been worked by machinery), its
walls, glowing with the frescoes of the best masters of
the Ferrara school, and, above all, its enchanting—if
not, as Tasso describes them, enchanted—gardens.
For these ducal pleasure–grounds furnished, it is
said, the model whence the poet drew his well–known
description of the gardens of Armida.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PERFORMANCE OF TERENCE.</div>

<p>The next day there is the usual ceremony of the state
entry into the city. The cannon fire, and the bells
ring; the crown prince Alphonso, with an hundred
youths, chiefly of the students of the University, bring
the keys of the city in a golden basin to the feet of his
Holiness, who kisses the prince on the forehead. Then
he has to hear an oration, then to be carried in a chair
on men's shoulders all round the city, blessing all the
way, till his arm is ready to drop off, then to "attend
service" at the Cathedral—(adorned for the occasion
by four pieces of arras belonging to the Duke, valued
at sixty thousand crowns, some three hundred thousand
pounds sterling, at least, of our present money!)—then
to hear more orations; and then, it is to be
hoped, to be put to bed. For in truth, for an octogenarian
Servus servorum, such a day's work must have
been harder than that of most of his masters.</p>

<p>The next day the Duchess has to do her share of
the hard work, and with seventy–two ladies all on
horseback, and all dressed in black and gold, and
twenty–two cars full of other ladies following them,
"made several circuits of the city."</p>

<p>But the grand day was the third, which happened to
be the festival of St. George, the patron saint of Ferrara.
The Pope had to do pontifical mass in the cathedral to
begin with. After dinner, he was present at a tournament
held in his honour. And after supper the
"Adelphi" of Terence was performed before him and
all the great folks assembled, by the sons and daughters
of the Duke, and doubtless also by our Olympia.</p>

<p>Muratori, in his "Antiquities of the House of Este,"
rehearses the different parts sustained by the three
princesses and their two brothers, but says nothing of
the share Olympia had in the fête. But this, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
is quite in accordance with the natural instincts of a
court historian. It is likely enough, however, that the
poor schoolmaster's daughter, who would most assuredly
have eclipsed her fellow comedians, was not permitted
to have the opportunity of committing such a solecism.
But it is impossible that such a business could have
been afoot in the court of Ferrara, and that Olympia
should not have had a leading share in the guidance of
it, behind if not before the curtain.</p>

<p>As a detached bit of sixteenth century life, brought
up out of the dark past, and made to flit for a moment
before our vision by history's magic lanthorn, it is a
pretty and striking scene enough, and interestingly
characteristic of tastes and manners,—this venerable
(looking) octogenarian pontiff, with his eighteen cardinals
and forty bishops, &amp;c., sitting there to hear a group
of royal children, of whom the youngest was only five
years old, declaim the rough comedy of ancient Rome!
Little Luigi, sustained the part of a slave, Muratori
tells us; and had not, we must suppose, much to say.</p>

<p>Amid all these festivities and amusements the Pope
and the Duke had to find time for long colloquies, the
subjects of which, we are told, were kept secret, but
which may be easily divined.</p>

<p>The old investiture difficulty was not settled yet; and
the new inquisition had to be established in Ferrara.
Here, then, the proposed body and soul arrangement,
might, one would think, have been brought to a settlement.
But, as usual, the Duke assented to the proposed
new and more complete abandonment of his own
and his subjects' right to their own souls, but by no
means obtained the temporal advantages he was so
desirous of in return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HYDROSTATIC TROUBLES.</div>

<p>There were other matters, too, of very really important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
but altogether material interest, to be debated
between the Duke and the father of the faithful. All
the rich cities, with their fertile territories, which are
situated in the lower part of the great valley of the Po,
have suffered from the earliest historic times, and to
the present day still suffer from very great difficulty in
getting rid of the waters brought down to them from
the higher country by the Po itself, and sundry other
rivers. As usual in the compensatory processes of
nature, the same causes have produced their prosperity,
and the circumstances which tend to diminish it. The
whole of the wonderfully fertile region in question is
alluvial soil of extremely recent formation. Very numerous
and exceedingly curious discoveries, made at
different times within the last two centuries at various
points, extending over the whole district from Modena
to the Adriatic, prove that the country has been at
former times inhabited, when the surface of the soil
was from four to ten or more feet lower than it is at
the present day. On the left bank of the Brenta, near
Fusina, a mosaic pavement, and other Roman remains,
were found <i>in situ</i> at a level now two feet and a
half below that of the mean height of the Adriatic.
And a great variety of similar facts have been placed
on record,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> which satisfactorily prove that the level of
the sea has been raised, <i>pari passu</i>, with that of the
adjoining low lands.</p>

<p>The result of the process thus always going on is,
that an exceedingly small margin of difference between
the level of the land and that of the sea remains to
render possible the discharge of the waters from the
mouths of the different rivers. The fertilising materials,
which are brought down from the Apennines in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
vast quantities, not only tend to raise the general level
of the district, but also, and with much greater rapidity,
to raise the beds of the rivers, and obstruct their
course. From a very early period, this evil has been
met by the inhabitants by constructing lofty banks
along the courses of their rivers. The more the bed
of the stream became raised in the process of time, the
higher these moles had to be built to follow it, till some
of the rivers now traverse large districts of country in
a perfectly artificial canal, constructed upon, instead of
in, the face of the soil. Near Ferrara itself, the surface
of the Po is now higher, it is said, than the highest
building in the city.</p>

<p>In such a state of things, it may easily be imagined
how important a public concern was, and still is, the
maintenance and regulation of these vast artificial banks,
and how vital a question the management of the waters
of those secondary streams, which contribute their
volume to the mass that threatens the lower country.</p>

<p>Then, again, the disputes inevitably arising from the
conflicting interests of adjacent districts, in this respect,
were further complicated by differences of an exactly
opposite kind. For the waters, which, under certain
conditions, were agents of destruction, which all were
eager to escape at the expense of their neighbours,
were, under other circumstances, creators of fertility
and wealth, which all sought to appropriate to their
own advantage.</p>

<p>Thus the Reno, which comes from the Apennines
above Bologna, and is one of the most important of the
tributaries of the Lower Po, had been modified in its
course by embankments, which tended to divert its
waters from the extensive rice grounds of Bologna
and Imola, and bring them into the Ferrarese branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the Po, which the people of that city at that time
feared would, from the encumberment of its bed, soon
become unnavigable.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WATER DISPUTES.</div>

<p>Here then was matter for interminable dispute and
negotiation between the two governments,—disputes,
too, which, in the hands of their more immediately
interested subjects, gave rise to perpetual acts of lawless
violence, to quarrels, and, on more than one occasion,
even to pitched battles between commune and
commune. For in the season of the floods, when the
ruin of a whole district from anticipated inundation
might be prevented by the cutting of an embankment,
and thus averting the devastation from one's own to
one's neighbour's fields; or when, in the summer, the
fertilising stream, precious as a Pactolus, was insufficient
for all the demands upon it, it could hardly be
expected that such acts should not be resorted to,
especially when, from the undecided condition of all the
questions concerning the law of the case, either party
honestly believed themselves to be in the right.</p>

<p>Thus, thrice in the course of the year 1542, the embankments
of the Reno had been cut through in the
night–time,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and it was whispered that the Duke
himself was the instigator of the deed,—an opinion,
which was strengthened by the evident unwillingness
of the authorities to discover and punish the offenders.</p>

<p>But in this matter of the waters, as in the other
affair, the Duke had to concede all and obtain nothing.
The Pope deferred his decision till his return to Rome,
and then gave sentence in his own favour, by awarding
to the Bolognese all the advantages in dispute.</p>

<p>Olympia continued to be an inmate of the palace for
about five years after the memorable visit of Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Paul to Ferrara: five more happy sunshine years of
Undine–Muse existence. The public declamations, the
triumphs, the homage of the learned,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the interchange
of complimentary poetry, the heathen philosophisings
on Scipio's dream, and such like matters, went on as
before. A more brilliant creature than this beautiful
young priestess in the Temple of Minerva, or a sunnier
existence, it is impossible to conceive. But had her
life reached its term before the end of this summer–tide
period, she would not have left behind her the fair
claim to be remembered as one of the noblest types on
record of true womanly excellence, which she afterwards
made good. The depths of her moral nature
slept like an unstirred lake, while the intellectual portion
of her being was in full and energetic activity.
And the subsequent completion of a noble character
by the awakening of her soul at that fire–touch, which
is woman's true Prometheus spark, shows us a psychological
study of great beauty and interest.</p>

<p>But a very noteworthy indication of the <i>genuineness</i>
of her nature, of the sincere simplicity of her enthusiasm
and Muse–ship, and the sympathetic loveableness
of her character, is to be found in the fact, that in the
midst of her triumphant career, while she was the
cynosure of all male eyes, and the object of so much
male admiration, she formed the most durable and
loving friendships with all that was best and noblest in
the female world around her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEMALE FRIENDS.</div>

<p>The attachment which existed between her and the
companion of her studies, Anne d'Este, has been
mentioned. It must have been at an early period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
her residence at the court, that she and one of the
ladies of the Duchess, Francesca Bucyronia, were
drawn together rather by a similarity of qualities of
heart than of intellectual pursuits. The learned German,
John Sinapi, Olympia's Greek master, and second
father, as she considered him, had also discovered the
good qualities of Francesca, and induced her to leave
the sunny skies of her own Italy and accompany him
to Germany as his wife. The friendship which had
been formed between the two young women in the
bright springtide of their existence was life–long, and
became strengthened in their after life under less brilliant
skies, and in less brilliant fortunes.</p>

<p>Another friendship, of perhaps a yet closer and more
intimate kind, was that which sprung up between
Olympia and the Princess Lavinia della Rovere. This
daughter of the Ducal family of Urbino had recently
married Paolo Orsini, when, at the court of Ferrara,
she became acquainted with Olympia. Lavinia,
says the historian of her husband's family,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> "was a
lady of most excellent and cultivated mind, inasmuch
as, besides her other rare and excellent qualities, she
was devoted to philosophy and the other branches of
profane literature;" "alla filosofia, e all'altre belle
lettere humane." This, too, was a friendship for life;
and, despite the wide difference in the social standing
and circumstances of the two friends, was one, in which
the most perfect equality of affection placed these two
natures—highly gifted both—in the relative position
to each other, which their respective calibre of intellect
made the fitting and natural one, of guide and
guided, as is seen from the letters of Olympia in after
life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>The remarkable limitation in Sansovino's above
quoted eulogy to excellence in philosophy and <i>profane</i>
literature, would seem to imply that Lavinia, at the
time of which the writer is speaking, had paid no
attention to the theological questions which were agitating
the world. It may be, that the orthodox historian
of the house of Orsini merely intended to indicate in
a manner reflecting as little scandal as might be on
the family of his patron, that in the province of religion
there was little good to be said of the lady Lavinia.
Either meaning on the part of a good Catholic would
have done her little wrong at the time of her companionship
with Olympia at the court of Ferrara.</p>

<p>The general movement of mind, and the ventilation
of theological questions which was stirring society
from the monk's cell to the lady's bower, had produced
on both the friends a destructive, but as yet no constructive
result. They had ceased to believe the incredibilities
taught by the Church; and their emancipation
had brought them to a state,—if not of entirely comfortable
and contented indifferentism, yet to one of
unanxious infidelity, in which their meditations were
rather curious speculations, than struggles for vital
truth.</p>

<p>This state of mind is clearly indicated by passages
of Olympia's letters of an after period, joined to the
traces yet left of her pre–occupations and studies at
that time. Writing after her own mind had attained
firm convictions, she exhorts her friend to "lay aside
that old error, which formerly induced us to think
that, before calling on God, it was necessary to know
whether we had been from eternity elected by him.
Rather let us, as he commands us, first implore his
mercy, and then, when we have done so, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
know of a certainty, that we are of the number of
elect."</p>

<div class="sidenote">INDIFFERENTISM.</div>

<p>It is needless now–a–days to stop to point out how
this method of defending the tenets of Calvinism consists
in simply abandoning them. The use of the passage
quoted is only to show, that when the two friends
had talked of these things together at Ferrara, they
had been prevented from adopting the reformer's faith
by these perplexities.</p>

<p>And this difficulty of finding the way to any firm
standing ground of conviction was not a cause of unhappiness
or struggle to these pure young hearts. Witness
Olympia's subsequent opinion of her then state of
mind.</p>

<p>"Had I remained longer at court," she writes<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> to
her earliest friend Celia Curione, "it would have been
all over with me and my salvation. For never while I
remained there, could I attain the knowledge of aught
lofty or divine, or read the books of either Testament."</p>

<p>The two young women talked of these subjects, soon
discovered that they sympathised in utter alienation
from the faith of the Church, compared their difficulties
as to the new doctrines in vogue, and turned to the
more congenial subjects of pagan philosophy and
Augustan literature;—Olympia, for example, to the
amusement of translating into the language of Cicero
a couple of the fables of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>They are the first and second of the entire Decameron;
a circumstance which looks as if it had been
the translator's intention to proceed with the work.
But they are such as to make the selection of them, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
they were selected, sufficiently indicative of the tone
of thinking and speaking of Church matters in those
secret inner women's chambers of the Ferrara palace,
which the Duke found it so impossible to purify from
the heretical smell.</p>

<p>In the first place it may be observed, that the two
"Novelle" in question are free from the indecency
which marks so many of the collection. But they are
among those which hit hardest the ecclesiastical shortcomings
and absurdities of the age. In the first Ser
Ciappelletto, who is described as one of the most worthless
scoundrels who ever lived, sends for a friar when
on his death–bed, and makes such a confession of all
sorts of virtues, under the guise of remorseful dissatisfaction
at the imperfection of them, that the confessor
has him buried in a costly tomb at the expense of his
convent, where his body forthwith begins to work miracles
in the most satisfactory manner. The author, as
if afraid of the telling force of his own satire, and the
conclusions to which it naturally points, finishes by
remarking, that after all it is impossible to deny that
Ser Ciappelletto may have become San Ciappelletto in
the other world by force of a sincere, even though
momentary repentance in the last instants of his
life!</p>

<p>The second story tells how a rich Jew was induced
by a Christian friend to go to Rome for the purpose of
examining Christianity at its fountain head, with a view
to conversion in case conviction of the truth should
reach his mind. The Jew notes well all that he can
see and hear in the capital of Christianity, returns,
and is baptised at once, alleging that nothing but
divine miraculous interposition could possibly enable a
religion preached and maintained by such men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
such means to subsist and find credence among mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EARLY COMPOSITIONS.</div>

<p>We can easily imagine, that such fun as this would
be well relished with all the zest of forbidden fruit in
the young Muse's classical version by the initiated set
of erudite freethinkers, male and female, that made the
circle of the Duchess of Renée. But Boccaccio is not
the author, to whom Calvin, or even Celio Curione
would have recommended one struggling with religious
doubts and difficulties to resort. Nor can we doubt
that Olympia, while thus occupying herself, was
in that state of religious indifferentism, which she
subsequently as we have seen, regarded as one of
perdition.</p>

<p>Another extant fragment of her composition, which
is marked by its subject as belonging to the last year
of her court life, places her before us, still as the
heathen Muse, drawing all her inspiration and her
imagery from pagan sources, even on an occasion
which might seem by its nature to require, if merely as
a matter of art, a Christian treatment.</p>

<p>Cardinal Bembo died on the 18th of February 1547;
and his loss, keenly felt by the literary world in all
parts of Italy, was especially lamented in Ferrara,
where he had been so well known and highly valued by
all the learned society gathered there. Bembo was, it
is true, a Churchman of the old school of Leo X.'s easy
going days, who found more pleasure in reading Plato
than St. Paul, and liked Cicero infinitely better than
the vulgate. Though inclined in all ways to liberal
opinions, he probably would have had as little disposition
to meddle in the controversy between the old and
new theology, as many a greek–play–learned Bishop
of George III's time, would have felt to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
moderator between the "high" and "low" schools of
our own day. Cardinal as he was, he might no doubt
have been permitted to be present at any of those little
gatherings of the unorthodox, under the rose, in the
apartments of the Duchess, without danger to any of
the set; and if he had there heard Olympia's Boccaccio
translations, he would have laughed at the fun, and
been delighted with the classical latinity as much as any
there. And this aspect of very mildly ecclesiastical
literary Mæcenas–ship was doubtless that under which
the amiable and generally beloved Cardinal had appeared
to Olympia.</p>

<p class="b1">Yet, had her mind not been still in 1547 wholly
uninfluenced by any deep religious impressions, she
would not have written on the death of a prince of the
Church in so thoroughly a heathen spirit as that of the
following lines:<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p class="psq20">"Bembo, the great light of the sea–girt queen,<br />
The Muse's glory, Bembo hath gone hence;</p>
<p class="psi20">Nor left his equal 'mong the sons of men<br />
In noble deeds, or witching eloquence.</p>
<p class="psi20">For Tully's self, with Hermes by his side,</p>
<p class="psi20">Recross'd the Stygian flood, when Bembo died."</p>

<p class="p1">Such as may be gathered from these productions
and occupations, and from her own subsequent
reminiscences, were Olympia's thoughts and views of
life and death up to this her twenty–first year. To
her, indeed, whose being had as yet been stirred by no
deeper feeling than gratified love of approbation, congenial
friendship, and enthusiasm for her favourite
studies, the age in which she was living might have
appeared one of "renaissance," as it has since been
discovered to have been. Not because she was able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to look out far, but because her view was as yet so
circumscribed. The social earthquake which was
heaving the world around her, had not yet awakened
her from her dream–life among "the haunts of the
Muses."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGES AT HAND.</div>

<p>Her talk with Lavinia della Rovere on the great
topics which were agitating the world, election, grace,
free will, and justification, was only such as may serve
curiously to indicate how thoroughly the general mind
must have been saturated with speculations on such
subjects, when two girls, neither of them feeling
strongly on the matter, could not meet and make
friends without diversifying their Boccaccio readings
and Ciceronian studies with chat on the difficulties of
predestination. The outside air must have been very
highly charged with an electricity of thought that
boded stormful changes. For the meeting and shock
of large masses of human thought always is a portent
indicating that much change is at hand. Absence
of much thought is an indispensable condition of
stability.</p>

<p>But the time was now come when Olympia was to
be waked from her Helicon dreams, and to be summoned
very suddenly to descend from her calm
Parnassus heights, step out into this storm–atmosphere,
and find herself under circumstances wholly unknown
to "Apollo and the Æonian maids."</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">Dark days.—The great question begins to be answered.</p>

<p class="pn p2">In 1548 Peregrino Morato fell ill. The master's
chair was empty; the scholar's desks,—those school–like
looking desks, which we may still see sculptured
on the monumental stones of old sixteenth century
professors in academic Bologna—were vacant; the last
new edition issued by Aldus, beautiful with the
delicately–cut types of Francesco de Bologna, and
damp from the press of neighbouring Venice, remained
half–cut; and the wearied scholar, old, we are told,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
and broken down before his time, lay on his poor
pallet.</p>

<p>Olympia hurried from the court to her father's bedside.
It was the first call to her of painful duty, a
great epoch in every life! Suddenly from the midst
of her bright–hued dream–life, her "Muses' haunts,"
and gay poetical imaginings, she was called to face
some of the sternest realities, that post themselves
like sentinels inevitable in the smoothest path of
mortal existence. Suffering to be ended only by dissolution,—the
mysterious departure of the loved one
for that dim uncertain cloudland, the existence and
nature of which have hardly hitherto been realised,
but which henceforward will be invested with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
interest attaching to the home of those who have been
our home–mates,—the newness of that solitude that
first teaches the startled heart the meaning of those
dreary words, never! never more!—these are the
divining rods that first reveal the hidden wealth dormant
beneath the flower–decked surface of many a
gifted nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MORATA'S DEATH.</div>

<p>Olympia's loving watch by the bedside of her
father was considerably prolonged, as he sank gradually
to his rest; and finally closed his eyes tranquil in the
assurance that the position which his Olympia's rare
talents and acquirements had attained for her, would
enable her to be the stay and protectress of her three
young sisters and younger brother.</p>

<p>But while this scene was passing in the humble
home of the worn–out scholar, events of a very
different sort were in progress in the palace home she
had so recently left.</p>

<p>Anne D'Este, Olympia's friend and companion,
though five years her junior, was now seventeen. And
her father, the Duke, who had in the earlier part of
this year been to Turin for the purpose of meeting
there Henry II. of France, the nephew of the Duchess
Renée, had then arranged with the King a marriage
between her and Francis of Lorraine, afterwards well
known to history as the Duc de Guise. On the return
of Duke Hercules to Ferrara the marriage was solemnised
on the 29th of July, 1548, Louis of Bourbon
standing proxy for the bridegroom. "The citizens of
Ferrara," we are told,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> "were not altogether well
pleased with this marriage; but they constrained
themselves to put on an air of festivity." There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
but little of this, we may be sure, or we should have
had the usual accounts of feastings and processions,
with the details of the dishes and the dresses, and the
cost thereof. The marriage seems to have been done
with business–like simplicity; and the young Princess,
regretted by a whole city, "who," says Muratori,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
"loved and reverenced her beyond all belief," was sent
off, to find shortly enough,—she too, as well as her
old playmate,—that life had other things in store for
her than classical philosophy and dilettante poetry.
The Duke, her father, accompanied her as far as the
frontier of his states, her mother and two sisters as
far as Mantua, and certain ladies of the court as far
as Grenoble; and there, the links of the chain that
bound her to her home having been thus gradually
severed, she was launched into the strange life before
her.</p>

<p>Thus, when Olympia had paid the last duties to her
father, and returned to the palace, her friend was no
longer there, and she found herself dismissed under
circumstances that showed her to have fallen under
the displeasure of the Duke. This blow followed the
other so closely that Olympia admits herself to have
been beaten down to the ground by them. And in
truth the burden suddenly laid on those young
shoulders, which had never yet learned that life had
any burdens which could gall the bearer, was a heavy
one. A sick mother, three young sisters, and an infant
brother in that poverty–stricken mourning home, all
looking up to Olympia, the pride of the family, the
admired, successful Olympia, the inmate of the palace,
whose friends and intimate companions were the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
ones of the land, and she driven forth into the cold
shade of disgrace, just at the moment when there was
so much need that some gleams from the brilliant
sunshine of her prosperity should have cheered the
cold home of the widow and orphaned sisters;—the
burden was a heavy one for that young heart, making
her first acquaintanceship with sorrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST SORROWS.</div>

<p>But Olympia struggled bravely with her difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
"Haunts of the Muses," and brilliant heathen Undine–life
were all left far behind; and that salvation question
began to be answered.</p>

<p>The cause of Olympia's disgrace is not clearly
apparent. M. Bonnet, who writes her biography with
the sympathy of a co–religionist, attributes<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> it to the
evil machinations of one Jerome Bolsec, a name of
very ill savour in the annals of Calvinistic Protestantism.
The suspicion that Bolsec had a hand in
this, as in so much other mischief, would seem to rest
on some phrases from a letter of John Sinapi to Calvin,
cited by M. Bonnet from the inedited correspondence
of that intolerant Geneva pope. But the few words
given do not seem at all conclusive on the subject.
It may be that the context is more so.</p>

<p>Jerome Hermes Bolsec was at all events a very
sorry knave, capable enough of any wickedness of the
sort. He had been a Carmelite monk at Paris, and
having got into trouble by unorthodox preaching there,
fled across the mountains, says Bayle,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> "to Renée
of France, Duchess of Ferrara, the common asylum of
those who were persecuted for adhering to the new
doctrines." The Duchess made him her almoner, as
we learn from Sinapi. And Bayle says that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
married and practised as a physician at Ferrara, till
he was exiled for some unknown cause. He went
thence to Geneva, and there had the fatal misfortune
to differ from Calvin on some points of doctrine. In
one of his pastorals to the Swiss churches, the latter
recounts how one day at sermon time "this rogue got
up and said ... that men are not saved because
they are elect, but are elect because they believe, and
that no man is damned by the mere decree of God—<i>nudo
Dei placito</i>—but those only who have by their
own acts deprived themselves of the election common
to all." Whereupon, says Theodore Beza,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Calvin "so
confuted him, belaboured him, overwhelmed him with
testimony from holy writ, passages from St. Augustin,
and weighty arguments, that all present, except the
brazen–faced monk himself, were ashamed of the figure
he cut." Plenty of reason for being ashamed of themselves
for all parties concerned doubtless. But Calvin,
who was not wont to be contented with mere argumentative
belabouring of those who disagreed with him,
had him forthwith hauled off to prison, and finally
banished from the Canton, as he might have anticipated,
when he ventured on the dangerous enterprise of
attacking the pet tenet of the Geneva pope's tremendous
devil worship.</p>

<p>Bolsec went to Berne, but Calvin's resentment
followed him there, and finally harried him out of
Switzerland. So he returned to his old faith to spite
the reformers, and published lives of Beza and Calvin
filled with calumnies so gross that even the controversialists
of the Romish Church have admitted their
falsehood, and given up Jerome Bolsec as a discredit
to either or any party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">JEROME BOLSEC.</div>

<p>It may be admitted then that this "most slippery
fellow, Almoner to the Court of Ferrara, by your
leave," as Sinapi calls him,—<i>vaferrimus in aulâ Ferrariense,
si diis placet, Eleemosynarius</i>,—was capable
enough of making mischief, if his ill passions prompted
him to do so. But as he was on his Protestant tack
when under the protection of the Duchess, it hardly
seems probable that he should have practised against
Olympia by denouncing her as a heretic to the
Catholics. Yet it seems plain<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that her shortcomings
in the matter of orthodoxy were the real cause of her
disgrace at court. The Duchess, who, as has been
seen, was much attached to her, did not, we are told,
attempt to interfere in her favour. And the most
probable explanation of this abandonment is to be
found in the supposition, that the suspicion and ill–repute
under which the Duchess herself laboured in
the matter of religion, made the danger of openly
defending an heretical delinquent greater than she was
willing to meet.</p>

<p>"The Duke," writes M. Bonnet,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> "urged as he had
been for some time past to give proofs of his fidelity
to the Apostolic See, watched with a jealous eye the
different movements of his court. He believed blindly
such calumnies as always find a ready echo in a palace.
His wrath, increased by the long suppression of his
suspicions, burst forth in violence the more terrible.
Olympia was the first victim."</p>

<p>The Duchess was herself by no means in a secure
position. When a little after the period in question,
one Matthew Ori, a Dominican monk, was sent from
Paris to Ferrara, as Grand Inquisitor, Henry II. "who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
knew well enough which foot Renée was lame of,"<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
especially charged him "to heal her." The monk
came and did his best, "gaining some ground, as it
seemed by his efforts." For "the Duchess feared her
husband, and his terrible method of proceeding against
those accused of offences in matters of religion."</p>

<p>The Duke's "method" in spiritual affairs became
indeed more and more compendious and energetic, as
Rome's fears and exigencies became more urgent.</p>

<p>Paul III. died on the 10th of November, 1549, and
was succeeded by the Cardinal del Monte, who took
the name of Julius III.; an easy and good–natured,
though passionate old gentleman, who loved pleasure,
quiet, and luxury,—inscribed over the palace he built,
"Honeste voluptarier cunctis fas honestis esto!"—"Let
all honest men enjoy themselves decently without
scruple!"—and troubled himself as little about the
business of life as might be.</p>

<p>This was not the sort of man for a persecutor. But
the progress of the Inquisition during his reign is a
remarkable instance of the degree in which the policy
of the Church overrides the individual tendencies of
the man who may be the temporary occupant of
St. Peter's chair, whenever either the imbecility or the
scruples of the latter may seem to endanger the
interests of the corporation over which he presides.
Whether the moderate, politic, and worldly–minded
statesman, Paul III., the poco–curante voluptuary
Julius III., or the pure and saintly sage Marcellus II.,
were pontiff, the crusade against free thought knew
no relaxation. Caraffa and his Inquisitors pursued
<i>their</i> work at least with zeal and unflagging perseverance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Duke Hercules took his cue readily enough as
to the duties of an orthodox prince; and as he had
the misfortune of labouring under the ill–repute that
attached to a wife of notoriously heretical inclinations,
it was all the more necessary that he should prove his
attachment to the Holy See by the most unmistakeable
zeal for the purity of the faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FANNIO THE MARTYR.</div>

<p>Under these circumstances the arrest of a young
man named Fannio, at Faenza, for holding and disseminating
heterodox opinions, was a lucky chance to
be made the most of.</p>

<p>At first, however, it seemed that he would turn
craven, and show no sport. The unhappy man had
a wife tenderly attached to him, and her tears and
entreaties induced him to recant, and accept his liberty
as the price of declaring that he believed what his
persecutors and judges knew perfectly well he did not
believe. But his life became intolerable to him under
such conditions. Though he had forced his tongue to
utter the lying words that were the price demanded
for his life, he could not live up to his lie; so he
"relapsed," was again arrested, and this time thrown
into the dungeons of Ferrara.</p>

<p>Some time elapsed, while his "trial" for heresy was
going through the regular edifying forms before the
tribunal of the Inquisition at Rome. Condemnation
was of course perfectly certain; and the terror among the
numerous band of more or less suspected Protestants
at Ferrara was great. Yet, hazardous as it must have
been to attract attention by any such manifestation of
sympathy, we are assured,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> that many visited him in
his prison, and "were consoled by his exhortations."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
It seems strange that such visits should have been permitted.
The Inquisition which had thrown him into
prison for preaching, could hardly intend that he should
have the means of continuing the offence with all the
extra prestige of martyrdom. And the fact would
seem to indicate, that the "secular arm," or at least
those subordinate executive officers of its will who had
not the same reasons for being in love with orthodoxy
that moved the prince, had little sympathy with the new
persecuting tribunal recently established among them,
and seconded its intentions as little as might be.</p>

<p>But it is still more surprising to find, that among
these clandestine visitors to this poor Fannio in his prison
were the lady Lavinia della Rovere and her friend
Olympia. Lavinia then dared to remain on terms of
intimacy with the disgraced favourite, when all, as she
complains deserted her. Lavinia ventured to seek her
friend out in her humble home, and risk subjecting herself
to the same suspicions which weighed so heavily
on Olympia. But surely this dangerous expedition
indicates a notable change of mind and feeling in both
these young women, since but a year or so ago. It is
but a very little time since those conversations, in
which the difficulties of the doctrine of predestination
prevented the young friends from accepting the
religion of the reformers; and since Olympia's state
of mind on religious matters was such as to lead
her subsequently to think that "it would have been all
over with her and her salvation," if she had remained
longer at court. And now, after the lapse of a few
months, we find the youthful pair sufficiently interested
in the faith for which a martyr is about to suffer, to
visit him in his dungeon, and "find consolation" from
his exhortations!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>Or should we rather suppose, that deeper thought,
a more serious interest, and ultimate complete adoption
of the persecuted faith on the part of Olympia and her
friend, were the consequences, rather than the cause of
their visit to Fannio in his dungeon; and that mere
female compassion and sympathy with a fellow–unbeliever
at least, if not as yet a fellow–believer, led them
to the prison. It is probable enough, that the first
heart–deep seeds of conviction fell into Olympia's mind
during that solemn and affecting prison conference. It
is a property of persecution to operate thus on generous
and noble hearts. The desolate, disheartening, and
precarious situation of Olympia's own fortunes, and
the severe lesson she had so recently received on the
vanity and instability of worldly prosperity, were well
calculated to prepare her heart for the martyr's teaching,
and open it to the emotional reception of a faith,
which, according to the avowal of its adherents, cannot
approve itself to the reasoning faculties.</p>

<p>With a strange and solemn authority,—almost as of
one speaking from beyond the awful boundary line, he
was so soon to cross—the words of that noble heroic
man must have sunk deep into the hearts of the young
women. For noble and heroic,—let more ignoble
natures chatter what trash they may of gratified vanity,
obstinacy, and such futilities in the vain attempt to
bring down the heroic to their own level,—noble and
heroic, with a heroism inferior to none other practicable
by man, and wholly unmodified by the intellectual
value of the conviction for which a martyr dies—is the
soul, that true to its own indefeasible independence
refuses, in the face of all the worst the body and the
heart lacerated in its affections can suffer, to abdicate
its right of self–sovereignty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>And like all noble emotions, it is a contagious heroism.
While the terrible circumstances of the place
and scene, never to be forgotten by either of them,
spoke fearful warning of the not improbable consequences
of the nascent convictions even then rising in
their minds, their courage was stimulated to confront
whatever danger might arise from the exercise of free
thought.</p>

<p>So Fannio and Duke Hercules both had their triumph.
The martyr hung, burned, and the ashes of his
body thrown to the winds in the market–place of Ferrara,
died a free man, lord of his own soul, and conscious of
having implanted in many another breast the faith for
which he suffered. The Duke showed his subjects
what came of presuming to have an opinion on matters
of faith, secured the approbation of his own conscience,
and approved himself a faithful and meritorious
son of Holy Mother Church.</p>

<p>It was not however till 1551, some three years after
Olympia's disgrace and ejection from the palace, that
Fannio was, after long imprisonment, burned on the
Piazza of Ferrara, the first, but not the last victim of
the Duke's anxiety to conciliate the Church. And we
have other indications, besides this notable prison
scene, that this time of difficulty and tribulation was a
period of rapid spiritual growth to her. It is difficult
to imagine a more violent contrast, than that between
the brilliant palace life which eight years had made
habitual to her, and the pale existence, made up wholly
of those elements both so new to her, duties and difficulties,
which passed in the narrow home overshadowed
by the cloud of disgrace, and tenanted by a helpless
family of five women and an infant brother, whose
education was one of Olympia's most pleasing duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">"GRECIAN VIRGIN," NO MORE!</div>

<p>Small space in her day now for polishing Greek and
Latin verses, or composing dissertations on the Stoic
philosophy! But two fragments of four lines each,
one in Latin, and one in Greek, have been preserved, as
the productions of this period of her life, passed in
quite other "haunts" than those of the Muses. The
old classic "Grecian virgin" tone is no longer discoverable
in them; and the topics show that her mind was
busy with an entirely different order of ideas.</p>

<p class="b1">Olympia was now about twenty–three years old, and
still single; and interestingly enough the Latin quatrain
above mentioned indicates that her mind had been
dwelling on the subject in connection with her religious
aspirations:—</p>

<p class="psq20">"Quæ virgo est, nisi mente quoque est et corpore virgo,<br />
Hæc laudem nullam virginitatis habet.</p>
<p class="psi20">Quæ virgo est, uni Christo nisi tota dicata est,<br />
Hæc Veneris virgo est, totaque mancipium."</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Or, in lines as poor and flat as the original, but not
more so:—</p>

<p class="psq20">"The virgin, who is not such in her soul,<br />
Small praise of her virginity can have,</p>
<p class="psi20">If Christ alone have not her being's whole,<br />
She is but Venus' bondsmaid and her slave."</p>

<p class="p1">Curious to note, that the mental daring which had
led to rebellion against Church authority on questions
of justification and free will, had not strength of wing
or originality enough to see the truth in a much simpler
matter, detect the fallacy of the Church's entire
system of celibacy, and comprehend that there can be
nothing meritorious in <i>wilfully</i> abandoning all the most
sacred duties of womanhood.</p>

<p>The Greek lines mentioned compare the consolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
that an afflicted heart derives from the contemplation
of a crucified Saviour, with the healing
virtue of the brazen serpent set up by Moses in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>Thus passed two years of trouble and sorrow, which
left our Undine–Muse a very different being from what
she had been before their discipline. That it was
painful enough may be read in a letter from her to
Celio Curione, in which she looks back on these dark
days.</p>

<p>"After my father's death, I remained alone, betrayed,
abandoned by those who ought to have supported me,
and exposed to the most unjust persecution. My sisters
were involved in my misfortune, and received only
ingratitude in return for the devotion and services of
so many years. How great was my grief under these
afflictions you may easily believe. Not one of those
we had in other times deemed our friends, dared to
manifest the least interest in us; and we were in so
deep a pit of adversity, that it appeared impossible for
us ever to escape from it."</p>

<p>There was at least one friend who had been tried in
the furnace of adversity, and not found wanting, the
brave and noble–hearted Lavinia della Rovere. But
this exception Curio was able to supply for himself.
He knew that Lavinia had remained, and was still the
friend and frequent correspondent of Olympia.</p>

<p>Our heroine has thus been brought to her twenty–fourth
year. The present is hard and unkindly around
her. Suspicion, neglect, and all the anxious ignoble
cares attendant on poverty, had by a sudden scene–shifting
taken the places of luxurious ease, admiration,
flattery, and troops of friends. The future was dark
and precarious. The bad times were every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
becoming worse for those on whom any taint of heresy
had ever rested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POOR MUSE!</div>

<p>In short, our gifted Muse stood bare and desolate,
and shivering in the midst of a very unharmonious
world in most sad and pitiable plight.</p>

<p>But the salvation question was beginning to be
answered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">The question fully answered at last.—Farewell, Ferrara!—Welcome
inhospitable Caucasus.—Omne solum forti patria est.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Yes! the question was beginning to get answered;
beginning, not more as yet. The process of life–discipline,
which was to "save" Olympia, to rescue the fine
moral gifts and capabilities from suffocation in an element
of unrealities, dream–life and Undine–Museship,
and to develope the latent capacities of nobleness in her
nature, and set her well forward in the Godward
path, which shall be, Faith hopes, pursued hereafter,—this
was beginning to make its operation appreciable.
The baptism of tears had done much. Olympia
herself thought that the question had been already
answered satisfactorily and in full. She had "got
religion," as certain modern sectaries phrase it. And
though the special peculiarities of her creed, as professed
by her hierophants, are as little calculated to
elevate the heart, or enlarge the understanding, as
any theory of divine world–governance can well be
imagined to be, the religion she had got was a persecuted
religion, and derived from that fact an immense
saving power, not naturally its own.</p>

<p>But creeds are shown unmistakeably enough to have
their home and fatherland in the brain, by the constant
exhibition of their powerlessness over the heart; which
persists in willing good or evil with most illogical independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of the brain's theories. And human beings
accordingly wear their creeds with a difference. Thus
these lamentable election and predestination theories,
mad and ungodly as they may be, as intellectual beliefs,
yet, by the virtue of the persecution with which they were
visited,—a virtue addressing itself directly to the heart—served
to commence the work of Olympia's rescue
from heathendom. But other influences were needed
for the maturing of the noble picture of womanhood
which her completed career offers us. And these were
now ready at her need.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THOUGHT BEGINS TO QUIT ITALY.</div>

<p>Italy is still the home of art. The citizens of the
transalpine nations still flock to her schools of painting,
sculpture, and music. But in all else she must submit
to be the scholar of her former pupils. It was not
so in the sixteenth century. In those days Germans,
Englishmen, and Frenchmen thronged the celebrated
universities of Italy for instruction in law, science,
medicine, and "the humanities." Italy was still the
acknowledged leader of European civilisation, though
on the very eve of ceasing to be so. Already the
orthodox prowess of Duke Hercules was busy in bringing
about the change. Human thought cannot be
made to advance straight along a path walled in on
either side, however long the vista within its narrow
bounds may seem to be. Men whose occupation is
thinking, will not carry it on at all, while large fields
of thought are prohibited to them on penalties, such as
those incurred by Fannio of Faenza. So the students
from the northern side of the Alps began to find that
Ferrara, celebrated as a seat of learning though it had
hitherto been, was no longer a home for them.</p>

<p>The learned Germans, John and Chilian Sinapi,
were of this number, as was also a young medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
student, their countryman and pupil, who had recently
received from the University of Ferrara his degree of
Doctor of Medicine, named Andreas Grünthler. He
was a native of Schweinfurth, one of the Bavarian free
cities on the banks of the Main; and was, we are
assured, of "honourable" birth, distinguished talents,
and the possessor of a modest patrimony. He had
visited most of the cities of Italy, and had acquired a
reputation for Greek and Latin scholarship, before he
settled at Ferrara, and dedicated himself to the study
of medicine under the teaching of the brothers<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Sinapi.</p>

<p>Having rehearsed these particulars, it is almost
superfluous to add, that Grünthler also was an adherent
of the new theology. And for him, too, Ferrara
was no longer a safe residence. But the Protestant
German student had lost his heart to the brilliant
Italian Muse;—lost it in the time of her heathendom,
and classical Grecian virginship! And though Ferrara
was deserted by his friends and countrymen, though it
was about to reek with the blood of martyrs, though it
was falling more and more from day to day under the
blighting ban of the Inquisition, how could poor
Grünthler shake the dust off his feet against it, and
go forth, leaving behind him her who had become
dearer to him than life, country, or friends;—leaving
her, too, now no longer in the pride and prosperity of
her Muse–ship, but in poverty, sorrow, and disgrace,
and in danger from the same causes, that made his
own retreat expedient? His friend and master Sinapi
had loved, and wooed, and won an Italian wife, who
had accompanied him across the mountains to his
northern home. Why should not he do likewise?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">FIRST LOVE.</div>

<p>But in the glowing Grecian–virgin days of court
prosperity, the gulf that seemed to separate the grave
German student from the brilliant creature who had
witched his heart was too great, and the contrast
between her summer–day existence and the pale life
which he could offer to her to share, too strongly marked
for him to hope that such an offer would be listened to.
It appears, indeed, that the offer had been made and
rejected; in terms, too, that would effectually have
prevented its repetition by a less devoted and self–forgetting
lover. That such was the fact may be
gathered from a curious passage in the first letter from
Olympia to her husband, which, for some incomprehensible
motive, her recent French biographer, who
gives a translation of the letter in question,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> has
omitted, without giving any typographical or other
intimation, that any part of the sense of the original
is absent. After pouring forth her love in the usual
delightful fashion of honeymoon letters, she adds,
"Were my feelings different I would not conceal them
from you, as formerly I plainly told you that I had
conceived an aversion to you;"—"<i>ut ante aperte me
tui odium cepisse significabam</i>."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It was necessary, it
should seem, that that Undine nature should be first
exorcised by the touch of sorrow, before the mightier
wizard, love, could be allowed to enter, and complete
the task of purifying, humanising, and elevating it.</p>

<p>But the dark days came; sorrow did its appointed
ministry; and then love spoke, and was listened to.
In that time of tribulation and trial, when all the world
had suddenly changed its welcoming smile to a frown,
when none of those she had once thought her friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
dared to manifest any interest for the disgraced
favourite, then Andreas Grünthler dared to woo, and
succeeded in inspiring as devoted a love as ever
woman's heart felt. Olympia was deeply touched by
the noble disinterestedness of her lover's suit. "Neither
the resentment of the Duke," she writes, long
afterwards, to her earliest friend, Celio Curione, "nor
all the miserable circumstances which surrounded me,
could induce him to abandon his desire to make me his
wife. So great and true a love has never been surpassed."</p>

<p>In Olympia, the unselfish affection of a noble heart
evoked, as the sequel of her story shows, a sentiment
of equally ennobling devotion. And thus, whatever
issue from the predestination maze the puzzled brain
may have fancied it had found for itself, the purified
heart furnished the completion of the answer to the
great salvation question.</p>

<p>The marriage was celebrated in 1550, probably in
the last months of that year. A "marriage prayer,"
in eight Greek verses by Olympia, has been preserved
among her works. Her latest biographer<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> says of
these lines, that they are a "chant of Pindar repeated
by an echo of the Christian revival at Ferrara"—a
performance, one would think, nearly equivalent to that
of the well–known Irish echo that answered "How do
you do?" by "Pretty well, I thank you." The lines in
question touch, in very irreproachable Greek, on the
analogy between marriage and the mystic union of
Christ with the souls of the faithful, and are remarkable
only as indicating how complete was the change in
the tone of the poet's mind, since she classicalised on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
death in the manner we have seen in a former
chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARTING WITH HER HUSBAND.</div>

<p>Deep–felt and complete as we may suppose the happiness
Olympia and her husband felt at their union,
the marriage must have partaken more of a solemn than
of a festive character. There were many difficulties
and uncertainties yet before them. To remain in
Ferrara, heretics as they were, whose heresy was every
day becoming dearer to them, and the open profession
of it a craving desire; when Fannio was daily expecting
to be brought out of his dungeon to a martyr's
death; when the Inquisition was craving for fresh
victims; and when the marriage itself was deemed an
offence by the Duke, was out of the question. Yet it
was hard to leave a mother and sisters; and that rough
northern land across the mountains, where freedom of
conscience might indeed be hoped for, nevertheless was
not itself by any means in a condition to offer her a
secure and quiet home.</p>

<p>So far was this from being the case, that Grünthler
deemed it necessary to submit to a separation from his
wife almost immediately after his marriage, that he
might, before taking her to Germany, go thither alone
to fix on, and prepare, a home for her. His hope was
to obtain a professorial chair in some of the medical
schools of Bavaria or the Palatinate, and to be able to
return to Olympia in the spring of 1551. In the
meantime, he had the great consolation of leaving
her under the protection of Lavinia della Rovere;
whose considerable influence, though it seems to have
been exercised in vain to obtain Olympia's restoration
to the good graces of the ducal family, yet probably
sufficed to prevent any measures of active persecution
against her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is the letter above mentioned in its entirety.
Perhaps some reader may like to see, that a young
wife's honeymoon letter was in 1550 pretty much the
same thing, word for word, as a similar effusion in 1850
might be. Of no letter on any other topic, three hundred
years old, could the same be said.</p>

<p>"Your departure," writes the lovely wife, "was a
great grief to me, and the long absence following it the
greatest misfortune that could have befallen me. For
when I have you by my side, I am not tormented by
the anxieties that now beset me. I am always imagining
that you have had a fall, or broken your limbs, or
been frozen by the extreme cold. And perhaps I have
not imagined anything worse than the reality! You
know the poet's saying—</p>

<p class="pn center p1 reduct">"Res est soliciti plena timoris amor."</p>

<p class="pn center p1 reduct">"Love is a thing compact of jealous fears."<br /></p>

<p class="pn p1">Now, if you would alleviate this haunting anxiety,
which I cannot shake off, you will, if possible, contrive
to let me know what you are doing, and how you
are. For, I swear to you, that my whole heart is
yours, as you know full well. Did I feel differently, I
would not hide it from you; even as I formerly owned
to you that I had conceived an aversion to you. Would
that I were with you, my husband, if only the better
to tell you the immensity of my love. You would not
believe how I pine in your absence. There is nothing
so difficult or so disagreeable that I would not do to
please you, my husband. But can you wonder that
this delay is hateful to me; for true love abominates
and will not endure delay. Any other trial to which I
could be put would be better for me than this. I beg
and beseech you, therefore, to leave no stone unturned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to bring about our meeting this summer as you promised.
I know well that your affection is equal to
mine; so I will not weary you by urging this point
further. Nor have I said thus much in any wise to
blame you, but only to remind you of your promise,
though I know that you are fully occupied with all
these cares."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO HER HUSBAND.</div>

<p>Thus much may be found in "the complete letter
writer," under the heading, "A young wife's first letter
to an absent husband." What follows is of more
interest.</p>

<p>"As to my dresses, I do not think that it would be
becoming to make application for them to the court.
The Duchess sent me word by one of her women, that
it was not true that the wife of the most noble Camillo
(Orsini) had said any thing to her about sending greetings
to her daughter. (Her daughter–in–law, Lavinia
della Rovere, wife of her son Paolo Orsini, seems to be
intended.) She said, however, that she would permit
it to be done, since her daughter (that is the Duchess's
daughter, Leonora, apparently) wished it; but that she
(Lavinia) had begged one dress for me, which she (the
Duchess) would not give me before her (Lavinia's)
return. I think that she answered thus: that I might
see that she did nothing for my sake, but for that of
Lavinia; and that she might gratify Lysippa, who was,
I believe, with her at the time. But it is better to be
silent respecting a matter which is plain to everybody.
In any case, I scarcely think that I shall get the
dresses. Adieu."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to understand what the connection can
have been between the salutations sent or not sent by
the wife of Camillo Orsini, and the restoration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Olympia's dresses. Thus much, at all events, seems
clear however, that when Olympia fell into disgrace at
the court, her sovereigns stooped to, what to our notions
would appear, the utterly incredible meanness of retaining
the dresses belonging to her that happened to be
under their roof! We may suppose that these dresses
had been probably enough supplied by the Duchess.
It may be also remembered, that such things were of
very much greater value, both absolutely and relatively
to other property, than they are now. Yet, if originally
furnished by the Duchess, they had been given to
Olympia as a part of the remuneration for her services;
she evidently considers them as her own property.
And this forcible detention of a dismissed servant's
wearing apparel cannot but be felt to indicate on the
part of these princes, in the midst of their ostentatious
magnificence, a degree of insensibility to any of the
feelings that we compendiously term gentleman–like,
that makes the circumstance a very curious trait of the
manners of the period.</p>

<p>It would seem clear, also, that the Duchess Renée
was actively hostile to her former favourite. And if
the phrase, in connection with Lysippa, to the effect
that it was better to say nothing of so notorious a
matter, is to be supposed to allude to some court
intrigue in which she was concerned, it would seem
that Jerome Bolsec was not altogether the contriver of
her disgrace. It is remarkable that her old friend
Curio, in a letter written from Bâle to a friend of his,
who had asked him about Olympia, in giving a little
sketch of her career, suppresses all mention of this
court disgrace,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> merely saying that she had been called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
to the court to share the studies of the Princess
Anne, and that she had after that married Andreas
Grünthler.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OTHER LETTERS.</div>

<p>Her husband's absence was a sore trial to Olympia,
which demanded all, or somewhat more than all, her
fortitude.</p>

<p>Her first letter to her husband was soon followed by
a second, imploring him to hasten his return. "The
uncertainty of the time fixed for your return, and for
our departure from Ferrara, causes me incessant torment."
She beseeches him not to conceal from her
any bad news respecting their prospects. "Should
you be called on to meet any danger, which God forbid,
I insist on sharing it with you. But above all, my
well–beloved, in these so difficult circumstances, be
sure that God is our most powerful protector." She
exhorts him to remember that God granted the prayer
of Elias, so that no rain fell for three years and six
months, and to confide in him for support. "My
days," she concludes, "are passed in tears; and I find
no alleviation for my sorrows but in invoking the Author
of all mercies. May He be also your refuge and your
asylum. Write to me very soon, to let me know when
I shall see you, and do not set out on your journey
without sure guides. Adieu."</p>

<p>She writes five letters, following rapidly one after the
other, to John Sinapi, who was now established at
Würzburg, urging him to accelerate her husband's
return. "I again and again implore you," she says in
one of these, "not to detain him, who is dearer to me
than life, longer than one month at the furthest.
Send him back to me quickly, if you would not have
me, miserable as I am, pine to death of grief."</p>

<p>She reminds him more than once of a volume of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
poems, which she had sent to be presented to the King
(Ferdinand, King of the Romans), and to the great
Augsburg merchant, Raymond Fugger, in hopes of
interesting them in her husband's favour.</p>

<p>The lady Lavinia had also promised to induce her
husband and father–in–law to interest themselves in
Grünthler's favour; and there is a letter from her,
received by Olympia at this time, in which she tells her
friend, that she had after some difficulty succeeded in
accomplishing this. She was herself not happy. "As
for me," she writes, "understand that my affairs become
more and more hopeless from day to day." She concludes
her letter by saying that she should have written
it in Italian, were it not that she knew that Olympia
liked better to read Latin.</p>

<p>Lavinia, however, was at Ferrara during the greater
part of Grünthler's absence; and her society was
Olympia's greatest comfort. There is a dialogue
preserved in the volume of her works between the two
friends, which probably embodies the substance of
conversations that really passed between them.</p>

<p>"Will you always live then in the midst of your
books," Lavinia begins, "and never take any repose,
Olympia? Rest awhile, and you will return with
renewed vigour to your favourite studies."</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven, my friend," says Olympia, after
some few words on her devotion to her study,—"Would
to Heaven that I had not been so long plunged in
oblivion of the only truths worthy of occupying our
thoughts. I fancied myself learned, because I read the
books of worldly philosophers, and intoxicated myself
with the poison of their writings. But just when I was
most puffed up with the praises of men, I made the
discovery of my profound ignorance. I had wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
so far from the truth, as to imagine the universe to be
the production of chance, without governance and
without God."...</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIALOGUE WITH LAVINIA.</div>

<p>"But Italy," rejoins Lavinia, "had before this rung
with the fame of your piety and your virtues."</p>

<p>"It is true;" answers her friend; "and perhaps this
fame may have reached you—</p>

<p class="pn center p1 reduct">"'Audieras et fama fuit;'</p>

<p class="pn p1">but if men only knew how to estimate at their just
worth the flattery addressed to princes and those around
them, they would have judged me less favourably. You
at least, my friend, must know how far I then was
from having any sentiments of true piety."</p>

<p>Lavinia answers, that even so she cannot help
admiring the constancy with which Olympia had
devoted to the acquisition of learning those long hours
which others employ "in adorning themselves, in
arranging their hair, and in running after vain pleasures.
What especially surprises me is, that you could
remain faithful to those studies in the years of your
youth, in spite of the raillery of the men and girls, who
were always dinning into your ears that life had something
else to do, and that husbands would look more
after what you possessed than what you knew."</p>

<p>"It is the Lord who willed it so!" returns Olympia;
and at this point the dialogue, which it must be admitted
has been composed by our Muse in a rather egotistic
tone, passes off into a kind of rhapsody, in which the
writer sets forth the vanity of earthly things, and the
inestimable price of heavenly wisdom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Grünthler had been but very partially
successful in the objects of his journey. Germany was
in no condition to offer, in any part of it, a desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
home to a peaceful student and his wife. True, that in
many of its cities the profession of the reformed faith
was a recommendation instead of a sure title to the
honours of martyrdom. True, that the new theology
had there acquired a respectability of standing, that
enabled it to enjoy a share occasionally of the ecclesiastical
luxury of persecuting its opponents. But the
country was distracted by war or rumours of war on all
sides;—war of a different kind, and productive of very
different national results from the miserable mercenary
contests, which ruined Italy, and only prepared the
way for the slavery and degradation of the nation. For
the gist of the German fighting, however confused,
barbarous, and devastating, was to be found in the
determination of men to resist authority and oppression,
to have souls of their own, and to say they were
their own.</p>

<p>Though the division of the country into two camps
by their religious differences enabled princes to play off
one part of the people against another in the interests
of their own rivalries and ambitions, yet the contests
were mostly made to wear the appearance of struggles
for the securing of spiritual or civil freedom. And all
the misery brought about by them was not therefore
unfruitful of good. Though the points in dispute
between the rival creeds were often nugatory, though
the better sense was not invariably on the side of the
reformers, and though good men lamented that Church
reform had quitted its proper sphere and duties, when
it allied itself with worldly policy and descended from
the pulpit into the camp and the battle field, yet even
so, and even then, the Reformation was preparing the
great career which it has run, and that still before it,
from which no man can ever more turn it back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE INTERIM.</div>

<p>Charles the Fifth was just then busy in imposing his
"Interim" on the German cities. The great council
at Trent, which was to "heal the wounds of Christendom,"
made but small progress in that business; manifested,
indeed, a fertility of resource in the discovery of
means how not to do any thing of the sort, perfectly
marvellous. And Charles, who was perfectly earnest
in wishing that these wounds should be healed, or at all
events closed up in some sort, for reasons of his own,
very much of the nature of those which make a coachman
wish that his team may be coupled up, so as to
draw well together, became impatient. It struck his
royal mind, that the thing must be easy enough if one
only went about it in a simple straightforward manner.
So he ordered three divines,—Julius Pflug and Helding,
on the Catholic side, and one Agricola, a "practical"
man, inclined, when he got his cue, to make things
pleasant, on the Protestant side,—to draw up a scheme
of a good working religion, such as all men might
accept without objection,—or despite objection, if it
came to that; and to be quick about it. On the 15th
of May, 1548, his Majesty was gracious enough to lay
the scheme so drawn before the diet; whereupon the
Elector of Mentz declared it to be as good a religion as
any man need wish for; and being an Archbishop, it
was clear that he must know. And this was the celebrated
Interim; so named because it professed only to
be a provisional faith, for men to live and die—and pay
their taxes—by, till such time as what they really were
definitively to believe could be got settled for them in a
more regular and formal manner.</p>

<p>The indignation and disgust felt at Rome by the
regular practitioners at such quack–Pope practice as
this, may be easily imagined. The regular–bred Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
examined his rivals' prescription, and found, as we hear
without surprise, "seven or eight heresies in it,"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> all
clear and evident like so many false quantities in a
school–boy's verse task. Evidently a most unworkmanlike
production!</p>

<p>As to the Protestant cities of Germany, they found
the Interim religion to be flat Popery. And the royal
quack–Pope had to adopt the orthodox practice in
administering it. Augsburg, Ulm, Strasburg, Bremen,
Lubeck, Hamburg, Magdeburg, Constance, and many
other towns would have none of it. And Spanish
soldiers had to be employed, with more or less success
in different places, in recommending it to their favourable
consideration. At Augsburg, Charles placed bodies
of these troops at the different gates, and in other
commanding positions of the town, then called the
members of the municipal government to the town–hall,
dismissed them all from their functions, abolished
"motu proprio" the entire form of municipal government,
and nominated a few creatures of his own to
govern the city, each man of whom had sworn to receive
and observe the Interim. Ulm he converted much in
the same manner, sending off in chains the Protestant
preachers. The stout Magdeburgers shut their gates,
manned their walls, and stood a siege against the imperial
troops and the Interim. For a lay Pope's essay at
persecution this was zealous and energetic enough,
though falling far short of the true ecclesiastical practice
of Inquisition, stake, and faggot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROYAL VIEWS OF HUMAN NATURE.</div>

<p>It might be supposed that Charles would have
been too sagacious a man to have imagined that
any successful issue could have come of this Interim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
scheme of his. It seems hardly a thing to have been
hoped, that Germany had gone through all the sufferings
and sorrows, spiritual and temporal, incidental to
a national change of religion, and kicked off the authority
of a real Pope, venerable with the prestige of
fifteen centuries, to submit quietly to a new quack
Pope, whose whole theological apparatus consisted of
men–at–arms and gunpowder. If men were to submit
to an imposed creed, it was better to take one without
seven or eight heresies in it. No very profound knowledge
of the human heart, one would think, were
needed to enable a sagacious ruler of men to anticipate
failure for such a plan; and Charles has the reputation
of having been such. But it strikes one, in considering
this and a hundred other similar mistakes by
the Louis XIVths. and other great masters of kingcraft,
as doubtful how far it is practicable for such
personages to attain to any knowledge of the plebeian
human heart. Of the hearts of princes, ministers of
state, popes, cardinals, diplomatists, ambassadors, and
such,—though hearts are not generally supposed to be
worn on embroidered sleeves,—a royal craftsman practised
in the business may know a thing or two; may,
perhaps, if acute, obtain some uncertain notion of the
hearts of gentlemen–ushers, ladies of honour, grand
chamberlains, and other such samples of mankind:
but it would seem as if such knowledge were rather
calculated to lead a royal philosopher astray in dealing
with humanity outside the palace gates.</p>

<p>The mistake into which the sagacious Charles was
thus led in the matter of the Interim, was causing
throughout Germany the uncomfortable state of confusion
that has been described when poor Andreas
Grünthler, flying from persecution in Italy, came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
seek for a home and the means of supporting a wife in
his native land.</p>

<p>The search, as we have seen, became prolonged, to
Olympia's great distress, far beyond what the young
couple had calculated on. Grünthler's profession,
indeed, was one which the misrule of monarchs has no
tendency to render superfluous. On the contrary, he
had soon occasion to find that it provided him with
work in more than abundance. But then, as still, in
Germany, the professional chairs in the Universities
afforded the most reliable prospect of bread, with some
small modicum of butter, to a studious and married
man. Grünthler's education and talents well fitted
him to teach, and that was his ambition. But town
councillors turned violently out of their offices, or in
daily dread of being so, and burghers in distress, consternation,
and hot debate, between temporal and
spiritual ruin, had scant attention to give to such
matter. Besides, the lecture–rooms were empty, the
students dispersed to their own homes, as the most
necessary place for a man in critical and perilous
times, or joining in resistance against the oppression
that weighed on the country.</p>

<p>Andreas Grünthler could hear of no such position
as he had hoped to find anywhere. Still he had
friends who were influential, and much interested in
his and his wife's fortunes. John Sinapi was now
settled at Würzburg and his brother Chilian at Spire;
and both were eager to assist their Ferrara friends in
their projects. Hubert Thomas, of Liège, secretary
to the Count Palatine, was also their firm friend. But
a recommendation to George Hermann, of Augsburg,
councillor to the King of the Romans, which had been
obtained for Grünthler by Lavinia della Rovere from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
her brother–in–law Camillo Orsini, turned out the most
immediately valuable. In the impossibility of finding
any permanent appointment of the kind desired, this
truly friendly man begged the almost despairing professor
to bring his wife in the first instance to his
house at Augsburg, there to wait till they should be
able to see their path in some degree before them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREWELL!</div>

<p>The proposal opened a harbour of refuge when all
the trouble–tossed world seemed to refuse them a
resting–place. So poor Andreas hurried back across
the Alps to his pining mate, overjoyed to be able to
bring her some better tidings than his previous disappointments
had enabled him to write to her.</p>

<p>It was decided that they should start from Ferrara
for the promised land of free consciences and true
religion in the early summer of 1551. How constantly
had Olympia been sighing during the months of her
solitary life at Ferrara for the coming of this hour!
Yet now that it was come, this departure was found to
be a very sad business, not to be accomplished without
many a wrench of affections rooted in the core of the
heart. To leave a mother and three sisters, never in
all human probability to be seen again on this side of
the grave, was a hard task; and Olympia knew well
that such was their parting. In a letter written not
long afterwards to Celio Curione at Bâle, she expresses
her conviction that she shall never again return to
Italy, "where Antichrist is raging with such power."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
She would rather indeed, she says, seek a refuge in
the furthest and most inclement north than re–cross
the Alps. Yet that first quitting Italy—bright, sunny,
native Italy—and Ferrara, where she had known so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
much both of happiness and misery—"Ferrara my
ungrateful country," as she calls it in another letter<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>—was
a bitter moment. That crossing of the mountains
had, in those days of little travelling and roads dangerous
in all ways, something more alarming to the
ideas of an Italian girl than any possible migration on
earth's surface could now suggest to the most inexperienced
traveller. She writes to worthy George
Hermann,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> when there was a question of some distant
appointment for Grünthler, that having followed her
husband across the Alps, she could have no difficulty
in crossing Caucasus—"inhospitalem Caucasum," in
true classic phrase—or accompany him to the uttermost
ends of the earth, if it were needed. "Omni
solum forti patria est!" she adds. But the greatest
trial to her fortitude was the first step beyond the
marshy plains around persecuting, ungrateful Ferrara.</p>

<p>Painful partings are always most painful to those
who are left behind. The necessity of action, and the
excitement of going forth to meet new scenes and new
fortunes, brace the nerves and give diversion to the
grief of those who are to depart; and Olympia was
not leaving him who was of all the world dearest to
her. But what must the parting have been to the poor
mother! Her old friend and former guest, Celio
Curione, writing to her several years afterwards, recurs
to the sorrows of that time. "The pangs of that
departure," he says, "must have been even as the pangs
of death when you felt that probably in this life you
would never see her again. And truly you might well
feel that the separation of death was not very different
from that caused by so great a distance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE JOURNEY.</div>

<p>In fact, the poor mother never did again see her
Olympia. And she was soon after left in entire solitude
at Ferrara, in consequence of what she was bound
to consider the good fortune of each of her three
remaining daughters finding honourable positions.
Lavinia della Rovere took one of them with her to
Rome. Another was attached to the Lady Helena
Rangona de Bentivoglio; and the third to that lady's
daughter, who was married at Milan. This last, as we
learn from a letter from Olympia to Curione, became
the wife of a young man of that city, "an only son,
very well off in the world, who asked no dower with
her." With them, it would seem, the mother found at
last a happier home than she had known since she
became a widow.</p>

<p>Worthy Andreas Grünthler took his young brother–in–law
Emilio, then eight years old, with him and his
wife into Germany.</p>

<p>At length the last words were said, and the little
party turned their faces towards the mountains, and
began their journey by the pass of the Brenner.
There were more points than one in their route which
might have been dangerous to them. At Trent the
Council was sitting; and all travellers through a city
so occupied were likely enough to be subjected to
questionings that might lead known fugitives from religious
persecution into trouble. At Innspruck the
imperial army was quartered, which was not calculated
to make the passage through it agreeable or safe to
such wayfarers as our friends.</p>

<p>"The beauty of the season, and the magnificence of
the scenery that discovered itself at each step to the
eyes of the travellers," says Olympia's French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
biographer, "without doubt distracted them from the
sad thoughts that assailed them on their way to exile."</p>

<p>But it is to be feared that this is an anachronism.
The snow–capped mountains, the pine–clad valleys,
the precipices, the tumbling waters, and the craggy
peaks, were all there then as picturesque–hunting
tourists find them now. But men, Italians especially,
did not admire such things in the fifteenth century.
They only saw "inhospitalem Caucasum" in such
scenes. And to our little party it was Caucasus
infested with ravening bishops and their officials, with
men–at–arms and camp–followers. Under which circumstances
it is to be feared that they took small
comfort from any appreciation of the picturesque.</p>

<p>But the mountains and all their dangers were
happily passed, and the hospitable roof of warm–hearted
George Hermann in the good city of Augsburg
safely reached by the three travellers about the
middle of the year 1551.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center reduct">At Augsburg,—and at Würzburg.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Augsburg, in the middle of the sixteenth century,
had a fair claim to be entitled the Athens of the North.
Among the cities of Germany it held a place similar
to that occupied by Florence among those of Italy.
And in both instances the primacy attained in arts and
letters had depended on the fostering hand of successful
commerce. That which the Medici had done for
Florence, the Fugger family had done for Augsburg.
The latter name has not at the present day the worldwide
celebrity of the former. But then the Fuggers
never exalted themselves to sovereignty on the ruin of
their country; and flunkeydom has accordingly less
assiduously embalmed their memory.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, however, their name was
celebrated throughout Europe. Rabelais, writing from
Rome to the Bishop of Maillezais in the year 1536,
tells him that Philip Strozzi was esteemed the richest
merchant in Christendom, with the sole exception of
the Fuggers. Charles V. was their guest when at
Augsburg; and an anecdote has been preserved of the
fire in the imperial bedchamber under their roof having
been made of a faggot of cinnamon, lighted with an
I. O. U. of his majesty's to a large amount. It is true
that the cinnamon may probably have been the more
costly part of the sacrifice. Towards the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
century Dominick Custos, an engraver of Antwerp,
published a magnificent folio volume of a hundred and
twenty–seven portraits, "Fuggerorum et Fuggerarum;"
a somewhat cacophonous title, the strange sound of
which has amusingly caused the book to be classed in
more than one catalogue by un–historical bibliopoles
among botanical works, under the impression that the
ladies and gentlemen of the great merchant family
were specimens of ferns.</p>

<p>When Olympia was at Augsburg, the heads of the
family were the brothers Anthony and Raymond
Fugger. A contemporary<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> writer has left us a curious
account of the magnificence of their residence. He
speaks of the abundance of pictures by the great Italian
masters; of a large collection of portraits by Lucas
Cranach; and especially of a most extensive museum of
antiquities,—mosaics and statues in bronze and marble;—"all
the divinities of Olympus, Jove with his thunderbolt,
Neptune with his trident, Pallas with her ægis."
He mentions also a collection of medals occupying one
room. The number of fragments of antique sculpture
was wonderful. "We stood long in admiration before
a head of the God of Sleep, crowned with poppies, and
having the eyes closed. We saw several heads of Bacchus
of colossal size, ornamented with ivy and vine–leaves.
We were told that these remains of antiquity
had been brought together from nearly every part of
the world, but chiefly from Greece and Sicily. For
Raymond, though but very slightly tinctured with
learning himself—<i>litterarum minime expers</i>,—has so
great a love for antiquity, that he grudges no expense
for the pleasure of possessing these things; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
indicates the truly noble and generous character of the
man." He possessed also, despite his want of erudition,
a library, of which the librarian, Jerome Wolff,
declared in Greek verse, that it contained more books
than there were stars in the heavens;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and he commissioned
men who had the learning he wanted, to compile
a collection of ancient inscriptions, which was published
in folio at Ingoldstadt in 1534.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>It was to this munificent Raymond Fugger that
Olympia had charged her friend John Sinapi to present
a volume of her verses. As they were of course written
in Greek or Latin, we must suppose, unless, indeed,
the "minime expers" of Rhenatus is to be very widely
understood, that the Augsburg Mæcenas could not
read a word of them. Moreover, the wealthy and
worthy merchant would seem to have been far from
coming up to Olympia's standard in matters of religion.
For the Fuggers were among those to whom Charles
committed the government of Augsburg, when he
turned out the old municipality; and all those so
appointed, we are told, swore to observe the papistical
Interim. We are driven, therefore, to the conclusion,
that the religious world of the fifteenth century was so
totally dissimilar from that of the nineteenth, as not to
be extreme to mark the backslidings of men whose
position, like that of Raymond Fugger, put "so large
a power for good" into their hands.</p>

<p>We have no means of knowing whether the presentation
of the poems to the great merchant was followed
by any special result. But that the reception of the
wanderers at Augsburg generally was flattering and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
satisfactory is recorded in a letter<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> from Olympia to
Gregorio Giraldi, the gouty old friend, now drawing
very near his end, who used to write verses to her in her
girlhood. "We are still," she writes, "with our excellent
friend; and I am delighted with my stay here. I
pass my entire day in literary pursuits—me cum Musis
delecto;—and have no business to draw me away from
them. I also apply myself to the study of Holy Writ,
which is so productive of peace and contentment. Nothing
can be more favourable than the reception my
husband has met with in this town. Our affairs are
looking well, and, by God's help, will have a happy
issue."</p>

<p>A few months before the date of this letter, while
Olympia was pining on account of her husband's
absence, she spoke in her dialogue with Lavinia della
Rovere, of her regrets at having "intoxicated herself
with the poison" of the classical writers. And now
we find her again "delighting herself with the Muses."
The compatibility of classical studies with a strictly
Christian tone and habit of thought and feeling, which
many religionists have decided in the negative, seems
to have been mooted by Olympia, and by the advice of
her learned and devout friends affirmed. For in a
letter to Curione written about this time, she says that
"since pious men approve it," she will continue her
classical studies and writings.</p>

<p>But it would seem, that these "delights with the
Muses," however classical, were henceforward for the
most part religious in their nature. For almost all
that remains of her composition subsequent to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
period, with the exception of her letters, are translations
from the psalms into Greek verse. These her
husband used to set to music, and the singing of them
would often form the evening amusement of their little
circle. One of these translations had been sent to
Curione, who was probably the chief of those pious
friends who encouraged her to continue to write. "I
have read," he says, "the psalm that you have translated
into Greek, and I am delighted with it. I wish
that you would treat more of them in the same way.
We should then have no cause to envy the Greeks
their Pindar. Persevere, then, my Olympia, in the
path to which the Muse invites you. Place upon your
brow the sacred laurel; for you have drawn your
poetic inspiration from a purer fount than Sappho of
old."</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITH GEORGE HERMANN.</div>

<p>The stay of Grünthler, his wife, and their young
brother under the roof of George Hermann, was prolonged
for several months. The tranquil security of
her life there, after all she had gone through during the
last two or three years, was extremely soothing and
delightful to Olympia. The hoped–for professor's
chair was not yet found; but she seems to have been
in good hope that it soon would be. In the meantime
Grünthler had an opportunity of repaying in some
measure the generous hospitality he and his family
were receiving. For George Hermann fell seriously ill;
and his guest had the pleasure of restoring him to
health before he left him.</p>

<p>It was while still at Augsburg that Olympia wrote<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
to her friend Lavinia urging her to exert herself in
every possible way to save the life of Fannio.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks," she writes, "for your promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
to do all you can in favour of Fannio. Nothing could
give me greater pleasure; and I have great hope of
what may be done on the occasion of your leaving
Ferrara; for I am well aware how powerful is your
interest at Rome. Besides, I cannot doubt that the
Duke would be willing to gratify you when you are
taking leave of him. Entreat him then, if he wishes
to do you a favour, to release an innocent man, whose
long captivity would have more than expiated his faults,
had he been really criminal. That will be the moment
to speak, without losing sight of the dictates of prudence,
what your heart shall suggest to you.</p>

<p class="pn center p1 reduct">"'Haud ignara mali miseris succurrere disces.'</p>

<p class="pn p1">Above all, I exhort you not to allow the malevolent
representations of designing men to influence your
mind in matters pertaining to the pure religion of
Christ."</p>

<p>Olympia little understood yet the nature of the power
against which she hoped to prevail. How grimly
Caraffa would have smiled at the notion, that his prey
could be thus taken from him. A Duke of Ferrara
release a convicted and relapsed heretic to pleasure a
silly woman, herself more than suspected of sympathy
with his errors! Or that that contemptible voluptuary
at Rome, simoniacal usurper of Peter's keys, dare to
absolve him whom the Holy Inquisition has condemned!
Not while John Peter Caraffa keeps watch, as Inquisitor,
over the interests of the Church! As to the Duke, it
would have been saying that his soul was his own,
contrary to all contract, and saying so in a most
dangerous and blasphemous manner. And had even
indolent, easy–going Julius III. dreamed of dipping the
tips of his jewelled fingers in such troubled waters, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
would have found, as many a Pope has found, that
powerful as the <i>Servus Servorum</i> might be while working
in accordance with the powers of the machinery of
which he is a part, he was powerless to stop the operation
of it. Lavinia della Rovere, her sister–in–law
Maddalena Orsini, and the other generous and gentle
souls, who dreamed of attempting the absurd quixotism
of speaking mercy to a Church in danger, succeeded
only in leaving to other and happier times a record,
still by no means unneeded, of womanly protest against
priestly intolerance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITH JOHN SINAPI.</div>

<p>In the same letter to Curione, in which Olympia
speaks of her intention not to give up her classical
studies, she says that she and her husband would
willingly settle at Bâle if there were any prospect of
Grünthler's being able to obtain either medical practice
or teaching there. For still the future was all uncertain
before them; and yet the time was come when they
determined on no longer trespassing on the hospitality
of their generous host. John Sinapi, now established
as physician to the prince–bishop at Würzburg, had
pressed them to stay awhile with him; and they accordingly
removed from Augsburg to that city. Sinapi
had been the master of both husband and wife at
Ferrara. His wife, Francesca Bucyronia, had been
Olympia's friend at court there; and the reunion of the
party, under circumstances so widely different from all
that surrounded them in Italy, must have brought back
many a recollection of those old times and brilliant
scenes, which every one of the party was so thankful to
have exchanged for their present pale, and sometimes
difficult, northern life.</p>

<p>Sinapi and Francesca had several children. A niece,
Bridget, also lived with them; and in one of Olympia's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
letters of this time we find a Leonora mentioned as one
of the inmates of the family, and we get a fleeting
glimpse of the party gathered round the good physician's
hearth in the evening, with books and learned talk,
while Leonora taught the girls embroidery,—"docens
ambas acu pingere."</p>

<p>The tenour of this quiet life was one day broken by
an accident that happened to the child Emilio. He
fell from a high window to the ground on some rough
stones, and it was thought that he must be killed. He
was little hurt, however; and, as Olympia writes, "lives
and is well, to the great surprise of every one." But
the incident is only worth mentioning for the sake of
Olympia's method of "improving" it. This happened,
she writes,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> "that we might know by experience that
God hath given order to his angels to bear up his sons
in their hands." And again; "Thus God, who can
raise up even the dead from the grave, is wont to defend
and preserve his own in safety."</p>

<p>It is painful to find one, for whose character we
cannot but have the warmest esteem, and with the
feelings of whose heart we can always sympathise,
forming for herself such theories of the Divine government
of the world. How is it possible, we ask ourselves,
that such a one can have supposed the occurrences of
life to be arranged by a constant succession of miracles,
so that there is no reason to anticipate that similar
causes will produce similar effects? How conceivable,
that an Olympia Morata should pronounce all those
who fall, and <i>do</i> break their bones, to be none of God's
own? Her feelings towards her fellow–creatures were
assuredly not logically consistent with so monstrous a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
theory of the Invisible. No! but the creed was held
as a creed of the brain; and not arrived at even by the
brain by any process of reasoning, but only by intellectual
adoption of the theories of others;—probably,
even, to a great extent, of their phraseology only. For
the most entire sincerity is perfectly compatible with
the use of certain phrases imitatively adopted, and
believed to be proper to be said in certain conjunctures,
the sense, bearing, and consequences of which have
never been realised or examined by those who use
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOES TO SCHWEINFURTH.</div>

<p>Olympia and her husband remained with John Sinapi,
at Würzburg, till the latter part of October, 1551. It
was shortly after the accident of Emilio, that Grünthler
received an invitation from the senate of his native town
of Schweinfurth to settle himself as physician to the
garrison of Spanish soldiers quartered there by the
Emperor, when he himself went into winter quarters at
Innspruck. Though this was not exactly the kind of
employment that he would have wished, yet the proposal
was acceptable as coming from his own fellow–citizens;
and he was not in a position to allow any opportunity
of employment in his profession to escape him. He
accepted it. And Olympia, for the first time, was
about to find herself in a woman's best and happiest
position, a home of her own.</p>

<p>It was but an obscure one to which she was going.
But her name was already sufficiently well known in
Germany to ensure her carrying with her thither the
interest of a large circle of the learned world, especially
of such as professed her own faith. There is an
amusing indication both of the celebrity her name had
acquired, and of the uncertainty, that a small distance
could in those days throw over facts of the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
kind, in a letter written about this time by Curione to
one Xysto Betuleio, which has been already cited.
Curione's correspondent had written to him to ask if
the name Olympia Morata was in reality that of a
living woman; because it was very generally asserted
to be a fictitious <i>nom–de–plume</i>,—"De Olympia nostra
scribis te certiorem fieri cupere, quod plerique fictum
nomen arbitrantur." And thereupon he proceeds to
give that sketch of her career, which has been before
quoted.</p>

<p>In the brilliant springtide of Olympia's career, when
she stood before us in Grecian virgin guise, fooled to
the top of her bent by the applause and flattery of an
entire city, with syntax–laws for a rule of life, a knowledge
of words in the place of all experience of things,
classicality for a <i>summum bonum</i>, and æsthetic appreciation
of the beautiful as sole means of satisfying
every need and capacity for worship, the question was
suggested, shaping itself into the words so familiar,
and, howsoever diversely understood, most important
to every man,—How is this Olympia to be saved?
And the question has been dwelt on, because the peculiar
interest attaching to her story is to be found in the
particularly well–marked development of the saving
process, whether as studied by those who, like herself,
deem it to have been accomplished by her adoption of
a special creed, or by those who find it in the working
of her awakened moral nature. Both to the religionist
and the moralist Olympia is a specially "well–marked
specimen;" and both will concur in affirming that,
whatever may have been the saving influence, a very
noble specimen of womanhood was the result.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAVED!</div>

<p>Now, to one looking from the moral stand–point, it
seems, as has been said in a former chapter, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
question was satisfactorily answered, when the course
of our story had shown the heroine under the successive
influences of sorrow and adversity, of a true and devoted
love, and of the adoption of a persecuted faith, be it a
true or false one. And we have now reached the time
when this discipline will show its fruit in a "saved"
life;—a life fitted to make its close the starting–point
of further progress.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center reduct">The home at Schweinfurth.</p>

<p class="pn p2">"An obscure town; situated at the extremity of
Bavaria, and watered by an unknown river—such,
then was to be the asylum of this young woman,"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
writes her French biographer. But this is not a
correct description of Schweinfurth as it was in the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Far from being an obscure town, it was a free imperial
city, celebrated and important as the greatest
corn–market in all central Germany. Far from being
situated at the extremity of Bavaria, it was in the
midst of the most central district of German civilisation
and progress, and the Maine was not in the
sixteenth, or, unless on the banks of the Seine, is it
in the nineteenth century, by any means an unknown
river. Nor were "silence" and "isolation" the doom
of Olympia in her home at Schweinfurth. Writing
thence soon after her arrival to an Italian friend, she
says: "Besides, there are several good men in this
place, for whose sake we are glad to be here; and
most gladly resign to you your flesh–pots of Egypt;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>—<i>istas
ollas Egyptiacas</i>."</p>

<p>It may be admitted, however, that the contrast
between life at Ferrara and life at Schweinfurth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
great, but not altogether to the disadvantage of the
latter residence. Freedom of conscience, liberty of
life, the interchange of thought and opinion without
danger of the Inquisition, and the independence of a
home of her own, were well worth the sacrifice of Italian
sunshine, brilliant skies, and all the festal out–door
life belonging to them. And doubtless Olympia spoke
from her heart, when she declared, that she most willingly
resigned all share in such "flesh–pots."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO CURIONE.</div>

<p>The martyrdom of Fannio had dissipated the last
hope that Rome might be induced to adopt a more
moderate policy towards those who dissented from her
doctrine. Soon after this event, and after being settled
in her new home, Olympia writes to Celio Curione at
Bâle as follows:—</p>

<p>"You invite us to take Bâle on our way, in case we
should be returning to Italy. Alas! it is but too probable
that we shall never return! Indeed, we did not
come into Germany with any hope of soon seeing again
my unfortunate country. You must know well all the
dangers of a residence in a land where the great enemy
of our faith is all powerful. The Pope is now so
furiously persecuting our brothers in the faith, and
hunting them down so cruelly, that the sufferings of
the reformers under the last Pontiff were nothing in
comparison to the persecutions of the present one. He
has filled all the cities of Italy with his spies, and turns
a deaf ear to all applications for mercy. I would far
rather seek a refuge at the most distant shore of the
far west, than return to a country so afflicted. Should,
however, anything cause us to quit my husband's native
city, there is no place in the world I should prefer to
Bâle. Living near you, I should fancy myself once
more among my own people. I should at least be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
nearer Italy. I should be able to write more frequently
to my mother and sisters, the thought of whom is never
absent from my mind night or day. I could also
receive news from them more readily."</p>

<p>In another letter of this period from Olympia to the
same Italian friend,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> to whom she abandoned the flesh–pots,
we find a curious indication of the degree to which
Caraffa's inquisitors were pushing their system of
espionage, and minute watchfulness. Sending greetings
to a female friend, she cautions her correspondent to
whisper them in her ear, lest she or any other friends
might get into trouble by the mere mention of her
name. Nor was it generally prudent to write any
such matter at all. "I send you these letters open
on account of the extreme suspiciousness of these
days;—propter hæc suspiciosissima tempora," says she
in another place.</p>

<p>In a letter to Thomas of Lucca,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> however, written
about this time, which accompanied some money she
desired to remit to her mother—"aliquot nummos
aureos,"—she ventures to say of the Interim, that
"nobody has as yet been compelled to observe its
provisions, but, as before, all live according to their
own conscience." So that all the apparatus of men–at–arms,
and forcible changes of municipal governments,
had effected but little; and the Emperor's attempt to
play Pope had issued very much in failure. So difficult
is it to bring persecution for conscience sake to
bear upon a people, to all whose habits, manners, and
instincts, it is repugnant. Charles might issue his
decrees; and all those who heard them might receive
them with profound obeisance. But still it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
old story, "Water would not quench the fire, fire would
not burn the stick, stick would not beat the pig," and
Charles could not get his Interim to work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO LAVINIA.</div>

<p>One of the first letters Olympia wrote from Schweinfurth
was to Lavinia della Rovere.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> "Your spiritual
welfare," she writes to her, "is a subject of my constant
prayers; for I fear, lest, after your usual fashion,
you suffer your mind to be distracted, and its vigour
used up by worldly cares. Despite the various occupations
which keep me busy, I have composed the
dialogue sent herewith for you, in the hope that the
perusal of it may divert your mind from your sorrows.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
I suppose that the war with France has separated you
from your husband, and that you are in consequence
suffering the torment of anxiety. I have therefore
introduced into this dialogue some thoughts, which
seemed to me suitable to your situation. I send you
also some of the writings of Dr. Martin Luther, which
have been useful to me, in the hope that you also may
find comfort from them."</p>

<p>It must have been by a right trusty and devoted messenger
that writings of Luther's could then be sent into
Italy. The task of carrying them thither was very far
from being either an easy or a safe one. It is satisfactory
to observe, however, that Olympia's Calvinism was not
so strict as to prevent her from finding profit in the study
of the works of Luther: and still more so to note, that
from the closeness of her intimacy with Curione, and
the high respect she frequently testifies for his authority,
she probably shared his opinions on a subject on
which they were diametrically opposed to those of the
Swiss theologians. In a work entitled "De Amplitudine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
beati regni Dei," Curione ventured to maintain
that the number of the elect was greater than that of
the reprobate, a heresy of the most painful kind to the
Calvinistic mind. "It is a matter of great surprise,"
says Bayle,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> "that he could have dared to advocate such
a doctrine in the midst of the Swiss. For it is one
extremely objectionable to orthodox members of the
Reformed Church; and I do not think that any preacher
could maintain it at the present day in Holland with
impunity."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO M. FLACH.</div>

<p>Leaving, then, to the pious Dutchmen all the satisfaction
derivable from the "orthodox reformed" doctrine,
we may reserve to ourselves that of believing,
that a pure and noble womanly heart dared to be heretical
and human at least thus far.</p>

<p>In another letter, written about this time from
Schweinfurth, she noticeably recurs to Luther rather
than to Calvin for the means of converting Romanists
to Protestantism. It is addressed to Flacius Illyricus,
the classical alias of Mathias Flach, who was one of
the writers of the centuries of Magdeburg, and author
of a vast number of controversial works. Olympia
had never seen him; and writes to him merely on the
strength of his literary reputation. Having long been
anxious, she says, to find the means of providing for
her beloved Italy some share of that religious instruction
so abundantly possessed by Germany, she had at
length determined on applying to him, whose works
were well known to her, to undertake the task. "No
more would be needed," she writes, "than to translate
from German into Italian some one of the writings of
Martin Luther, in which the errors of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Church are refuted. I would not have shrunk from
the labour myself, were it not, that after two years'
residence in this country, I am still ignorant of the
language. Perhaps, also, you might write some work
in Italian on the subject; which, with your profound
knowledge of those Scriptures which I have
but dipped into, it would be easy to you to do. It
would be the means of enlightening many pious men,
now living in darkness. Should your zeal for the
truth give you courage to undertake such a work, you
may rest assured that it would be received on the other
side of the Alps with infinite gratitude. But for the
success of such a book, it is essential that it should be
written in Italian; for only a few of my compatriots
read the learned languages."</p>

<p>The dialogue mentioned in the letter to Lavinia della
Rovere, cited a few pages back, is one of the few compositions
by Olympia which have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> It
is a conversation between Philotima and Theophila, in
which the former, who is meant to be Lavinia della
Rovere, complains of the sorrows caused her by the
continual absence of her husband; "for there is no
greater happiness on earth than to live with him we
love. But this felicity is refused me; and my sorrow
is bitter in proportion to the eagerness with which I
had looked forward to happiness."</p>

<p>Thereupon Theophila, who is, of course, Olympia,
lectures her friend at considerable length, referring her
to "the holy women in the Bible, who sought not in
marriage the realisation of their dreams of earthly happiness,
but the glory of God;" with several pages more
in the usual strain of those writers, whose ethical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
system is based on the assumption, that every natural
affection of the heart is in its nature evil. It is curious
to recognise in Olympia's nearly irreproachable sixteenth–century
Latin, the common stock phrases, similitudes,
and metaphors, still in vogue in the Zion
meeting–houses and little Bethel chapels. The well–turned
sentences read very hollow; and though it is
impossible to doubt Olympia's perfect sincerity, or her
desire to school her own feelings into the unnatural
quietism which she recommends to her friend, yet we
cannot forget the very different tone of real feeling and
earnestness manifest in those letters written from
Ferrara during her own husband's absence, when she
talked of pining to death unless he returned within
the month! How came the glory of God and the holy
women of the Bible to be forgotten, when there was so
much need of the consolation to be derived from the
meditation of such themes?</p>

<p>Then there are letters indicating that the Scheinfurth
dwelling was beginning to take the semblance of
a home, with the means and appliances of a scholarly
life about it. Thanks to the intervention of good
George Hermann, the box of books has arrived from
Italy. The dear old books from the little library
at Ferrara, where Olympia had passed among them so
many, many solitary hours of ambitious girlhood; where
Curione had been invited to enjoy "the blessings of
solitude and peaceful study;" and in whose safe shelter
many a dangerous talk on grace, free–will, and absolute
decrees, had been prolonged far into the night! The
dear old books, each individual of them bringing with
it the well–remembered physiognomy of a familiar
friend! In these days of unlimited literary supply,
when books are made to be used like oranges, hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
sucked and chucked away, it is difficult to appreciate
fully the reverential love felt by a sixteenth–century
scholar for the precious tomes produced with so much
labour and difficulty, and acquired at the cost of so
much self–denial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHE RECEIVES SINAPI'S DAUGHTER.</div>

<p>All the books came safely to their far northern home,
except Avicenna, which was no where to be found in
the box! And Olympia writes to a German friend at
Padua,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> thanking him for forwarding them, and asking
what was due for their carriage. She complains in the
same letter, that for fourteen months she has received
no tidings from Ferrara, all her letters to her relatives
and other friends having remained unanswered. "You
have no doubt heard the news of the deliverance and
restoration of the Elector of Saxony—(John Frederick,
deposed, and long kept prisoner by Charles V.),—it is
the great event of the day."</p>

<p>Another indication that the home of Grünthler
and Olympia had assumed a certain amount of comfortable
stability, as also of the high estimation in
which they were held by their friends, may be found in
the presence of Theodora, the daughter of John Sinapi,
as an inmate of it. The learned physician had begged
his former pupil to receive her to be educated together
with Olympia's young brother, Emilio. The occupation
was one particularly well suited to her. Her whole
life, and all her associations, had been scholastic; and
if, in the general tenor of her compositions,—putting
aside, of course, questions of religious doctrine,—any
tone grates possibly a little upon the ear of one who has
pictured her to himself as a young, lovely, and fascinating
woman, it is an occasional slight echo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
pedagogue–ism, which is just the least bit in the world
suggestive of Minerva, with a birch in her hand, and a
pair of spectacles on her nose. She was herself childless.
In one of her letters to Curione, sending him
some of her Greek translations from the Psalms, she
begs him to "accept these verses, the only offspring to
which I have given birth. And for the present I have
no hope of any other."</p>

<p>In one of her letters to Sinapi, she reports favourably
of Theodora's progress. "Your daughter," she
writes, "every day learns something, and is thus, little
by little, putting together her riches."</p>

<p>Look, reader; see, if by putting your eye to the magic
glass, you cannot discern the little party framed there
in that autumn of the year 1552, in a rather large, but
very low, wainscoted room of one of those narrow high–peaked
houses, with quaint gables, seeming to be almost
endowed with physiognomical expression, that wink
and nod at each other across the narrow German street.
Doctissimus dominus Andreas is abroad among his
patients, of whom he has only too many, much disease
being generated, as usual, by the cramming of a number
of ill–paid, ill–fed, ill–lodged, and ill–lived soldiers into
the narrow quarters of a close–walled town. Olympia
and her two pupils are sitting near the small first–floor
window which projects over the street, that they may
have all the little pale light there is, as the three
heads bend together over the small, but well–cut, type
of that octavo volume of the Iliad which Luke Anthony
Giunta printed at Venice in the year 1537, and which
poor Peregrino Morato, being an exile in that city at
the time, bought with so much difficulty. The precious
volume is not endangered by any easy–chair fashion of
holding it in the hand, or letting it lie on the lap, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
reposes stately on a little wooden desk in front of
Olympia's chair, while Theodora and Emilio stand one
on each side the youthful matron's knee. The large
low chamber, extending over the narrow entrance
passage, and two small rooms, one on each side on the
ground–floor, occupies the entire extent of the house
on the first floor, and has two narrow windows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FAMILY GROUP.</div>

<p>At the other of these sits, occupied in some household
task, our maid Barbara,—she alone of all the other
maids–of–all–work, mending hose, washing windows, or
stewing saur–kraut, that day in wide Germany, still
extant,—a good servant enough, if "ipsius mores" could
be tolerated.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> For Barbara's immortality, sad to say,
rests mainly like that of some other historical personages,
on this questionability of her moral character.
Yes! there, clearly enough, sits Barbara at the other
window, doing what was to be done under the eye of
her mistress, who does not approve of her hand–maiden
running out into streets filled with Spanish soldiers,
and who finds, as she says at the end of the dialogue
she sent to Lavinia della Rovere, that all goes wrong
in a house as soon as the mistress's back is turned.</p>

<p>In the background of the large room are two heavy
wooden closed bedsteads, looking more like huge chests
of drawers than any other modern piece of furniture,
in which repose Olympia and her husband. For this,
the best and only good room in the house, is the lady's
bower and bedchamber. The two little damp rooms
below serve, the one as a kitchen, and the other as the
family refectory. Above, in the huge roof, two little
narrow–windowed chambers held the pallet beds of
Theodora and Emilio; and above these, squeezed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the narrowing roof, another cell, with its eye–like window,
peering out under the projecting eaves of the
gable, afforded a dormitory for Barbara of the intolerable
morals.</p>

<p>Something like this, I fancy, must have been that
quiet home, and the way of life in that pine–wood furnished
low–roofed chamber, where the daily lessons
occupied the morning; and where, in the evening, when
the good doctor had returned from his work, some one
or two of those "viri boni," for whose sake a residence
at Schweinfurth was agreeable,—learned Dominus
Johannes Cremer, or learned Magister Andreas
Roser, the schoolmaster,—fortis Gyas, fortisque Cloanthus,—grave
men in stiff ruffles, large dark–coloured
cloaks, and flat wide hats, which they retained as they
sat in the somewhat bleak room,—would come in and
hold sober discourse in Latin—(Olympia did not understand
German)—on the last new controversial work of
some shining light, on the probability of the provisions
of the Interim being enforced, on the certainty of the
doctrine of election, or the uncertainty of the movements
of the Emperor, or other such topics; and finish
the evening by singing together one of Olympia's Greek
Psalms, set to music by her husband; wherein one may
fancy that the pure Italian soprano of Olympia, the
childish treble of the two children, and the deep voices
of the musical German guests, as they joined in the
sonorous Greek syllables, under the guidance of
Grünthler's bâton, produced a performance altogether
<i>sui generis</i>. And all is well, if only that slippery
ancilla, Barbara, had not taken the opportunity of
running out into the street, and left perchance the door
on the latch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCHOOLS A PREACHER.</div>

<p>A pale life, vulgar cares, and monotonous duties for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
our Court–muse, so long accustomed to the flattering
homage of a brilliant courtier circle in the splendid
Ferrara saloons, glittering with gilding, and glowing
with the colours of Dosso Dossi! The contrast must
have presented itself sometimes to Olympia's mind;
but the recollection was more calculated to produce a
contented smile than a sigh of regret. It is a noticeable
development of a richly endowed moral nature,—this
change of one, who seemed so wholly and perfectly
made and fitted for the element in which she then
moved, into a being at least as thoroughly adapted to a
life so violently contrasted to it in all ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes the perfect adaptation to her new position,
as the learned wife of a distinguished professor,
not without authority in her circle, shows itself amusingly
in a little assumption of the birched Minerva
attitude, to which, it has been hinted, she had a slight
leaning. As when we find her writing to a divine,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
whose name is discreetly left in blank, in this strain:</p>

<p>"As I have good information that your backslidings
are frequent, I have thought it right to admonish you
that you are acting in a manner at variance with the
high dignity of your office, and disgraceful to your
gray hairs, in giving way to your appetite as grossly as
any Epicurus could do!" The gray–haired preacher,
it would seem, was addicted to excessive potations;
and Olympia's letter is long and eloquent enough on
the subject to have mended his habits, if it was in the
power of lecturing to do so.</p>

<p>Grünthler and his wife had hardly got settled at
Schweinfurth before a very eligible appointment to a
Professor's chair at Lintz was offered to him, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
George Hermann. The position seemed to be all that
could be desired, if only a favourably reply were
returned to one question, which Olympia immediately
writes<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> back to their kind friend and patron to ask.
"Is anti–Christ raging at Lintz? Shall we be permitted,
that is to say, to hold and to profess openly our
own faith? Because, having been enlightened sufficiently
to see and give testimony to the truth, our
eternal happiness would be the price of any turning
back from the plough."</p>

<p>The answer on this point was unfavourable.
All thoughts, therefore, of the Lintz professorship
were abandoned: and Grünthler and his wife were
contented to remain in their humble home in the free
city of Schweinfurth.</p>

<p>But the little family circle there was in the beginning
of 1553, broken by the recall of Theodora to the
death–bed of her mother. The premature death of
Francesca Bucyronia, who had been Olympia's friend
at the court of Ferrara, and whose destiny in life had
been so singularly the counterpart of her own, was
almost as deeply felt in the home at Schweinfurth as
in her own at Würzburg. There is a letter from Sinapi
to Calvin,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> in which he tells him of his loss.</p>

<p>"I had been absent," he writes, "from Würzburg;
and my return, and that of Theodora, our beloved
daughter (whom we had confided to the care of a matron
as pious as she is erudite, Olympia Morata, whose
name is no doubt known to you), seemed to restore
her" (his wife) "in some degree. But soon all hope
was gone * * * Oh! what a faithful and tender friend
I have lost in my Francesca. She had joyfully followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
me into Germany; and had quickly familiarised herself
with the language and manners of this country. She
preferred the simple rusticity of my countrymen, to
the insincerity and calumny from which she had
suffered during the latter part of our residence at
Ferrara."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAPPY AT SCHWEINFURTH.</div>

<p>This intimation that Francesca also had suffered
from the displeasure of the Court of Ferrara, at the
same time that Olympia had fallen into disgrace, would
seem to add probability to the supposition, that the
same cause, their common Protestantism, was the
motive of the Court hostility in either case.</p>

<p>Olympia's French biographer<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> thinks that this
period of her life at Schweinfurth, was "one of sacrifice,"
and that "isolation and obscurity were now her lot."
It does not seem to me that this Schweinfurth home is
thus fairly described, or that Olympia so regarded it.
I think that it included a fair proportion of the elements
of happiness, and that she was perfectly capable of
appreciating those elements.</p>

<p>If only the simple home, with its quiet round of congenial
duties and congenial pleasures could have been
preserved to the physician and his wife, their story
might have ended more in the idyllic than the tragic
tone. From lyric girlhood to idyllic matronhood the
progress is normal, and need excite no pity for its
"isolation and obscurity." But the sequel of the tale,
which remains to be told, renders it indeed a tragedy.</p>

<p class="pn center reduct">The makers of history.—The flight from Schweinfurth.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Happy times, and prosperous people, it has been
said, afford but small materials for history. But great
events, which were to shape the history of Europe for
centuries to come, were convulsing Germany in those
middle years of the sixteenth century. And the
amount of misery suffered by the hod–men and day–labourers
in this history–building business, was in proportion
to the greatness of the work in hand. That
"great man" Charles V. was a notable provider of
"fine subjects" for history. Poor, gouty, narrow–minded
specimen of humanity as he was, rising up
early, and late taking rest, at his weary kingcraft and
history–making, with a very unsound mind in a scarcely
sounder body; with "vast views," analogous to those
of the sailor, who having expended the first of his
fairy–granted wishes on "as much rum as ever he could
drink," could only utilise the third of them by asking
for "a little more rum;" and with a "large intelligence,"
equal to the most extended application of the
theory of that wise monkey who drew the chestnuts
from the fire at the cost of other paws than his own:
this "great figure in history" was a scourge to mankind,
useful after the fashion of many other such
scourges, to admonish men of the folly, meanness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
absurdity of permitting earth to be harassed by
such.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARLES V. IN 1552.</div>

<p>During the winter of 1552, this Charles, suffering
much from gout, and greatly troubled in mind about
the proceedings of the great Church Council, so necessary
for "healing the wounds of Christendom,"—for
coupling up the unruly cattle of the great European
team, that is to say, so that he, Charles, might have a
somewhat less desperately difficult job of it, in driving
them,—had taken up his quarters at Innspruck. All
paternal care having been well taken for the good
government of his German subjects, the Interim duly
published, refractory preachers chained up, and good
faithful Maurice of Saxony having brought the rebellious
Magdeburgers to reason, the mighty Imperial
intellect flattered itself that all was safe behind in
Germany, and gave itself up to watching the goings on
of the bishops down the valley below there at Trent,
and endeavouring to persuade them to give such assurance
of personal safety to the Protestant divines, as
might induce them to trust themselves on the southern
side of the Alps. For the smell of the blood of John
Huss was strong on the threshold of the council chamber,
and the Protestant representatives, driven up again
and again to the doorway, could not be got to pass it.</p>

<p>But Germany was not in a loyal mood towards its
Imperial master. The princes were discontented at
arbitrary infringements of the powers and privileges of
the Diet. They were angry at a recent attempt,
inspired by the "vast views," to impose upon them as
successor to the Imperial dignity that insolent, odious
Philip II., who had come from Spain to be presented
to the Electors, and, having thoroughly disgusted every
one of them, had returned to that more congenial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
country. And they were revolted by the Imperial
cruelty, faithlessness, and tyranny in the detention of
the Landgrave of Hesse in prison; and by the general
prospect held out by the Imperial wisdom, that Germany
would ere long be as well and orderly governed
a country as Spain. Then the burghers were of course
discontented enough. It is the nature of such people
to be so, as paternal rulers are too well aware.</p>

<p>In this state of things, Maurice of Saxony, whom the
Emperor had made Elector, when he deposed the
unfortunate John Frederick, began to show his real
colour. That good faithful Maurice, of whose attached
fidelity to his fortunes, Charles in his Imperial sagacity,
and the profound political insight of the Imperial
ministers had not the slightest doubt,—crafty, able,
Maurice thought that the time was now come for
throwing off a mask long carefully worn, and striking
a blow for himself and for Germany, that should effectually
clip the "vast views" and dangerous talons of
the Imperial eagle.</p>

<p>So he suddenly drew together and put in motion the
forces long prepared, and kept afoot on various skilfully
devised pretexts, rendered specious by an abundance
of "able" falsehoods, and made a dash at the
wholly unprepared Imperial eagle at Innspruck, which
all but caught him in his nest.</p>

<p>Charles had to escape as best he might across the
snows in dreadful weather, with gnashing of teeth,
gout in his legs, and et tu Brute! in his heart, to
remote Villach among the Alps; where, with a foretaste
of the later St. Just mood of thought on life
and king–craft, he had to wait in very un–Imperial sort,
till some accommodation could be come to with his
numerous enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DELIRANT REGES, PLECTUNTUR ACHIVI.</div>

<p>This was effected on the 2nd of August 1552, at
Passau, by a treaty of peace, which recognised, and in
some degree secured the Germanic liberties, destroyed
the life's labour of that mighty Imperial intelligence,
and thenceforth limited very considerably the horizon
of those Imperial vast views.</p>

<p>But, "quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi."
For monarch's madness, subjects pay the smart. The
law is inexorable. Despite treaties of peace, with
whatsoever oaths, parchments, and seals of the Empire,
the amount of misery due by normal action of cause
and effect for the "vast views," which Charles had
passed his life in endeavouring to carry out, had to be
paid. And that particular little fraction of suffering,
with which the present story is concerned, was assessed
and levied in manner following.</p>

<p>Among the various allies whom able Maurice of
Saxony had induced to join him against the Emperor,
was one Albert of Brandenburg, who, having been
Grand Master of the Teutonic Order of Knights, then
the rulers of a considerable portion of the country now
called Prussia, was so deeply moved by the doctrines
of Luther, that for conscience sake he was obliged to
play false to his brother knights, and seize on their
territory as an independent state for himself. Now
this Albert, being at the head of a powerful force of
mercenary soldiers, veterans ready for anything,—except
honest callings and peaceful labour,—and being
as M. Bonnet writes,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> "one of those brilliant types of
the medieval soldier of fortune, brave, adroit, indefatigable,
given to plunder, cruel, faithless, and lawless,"
was by no means willing, when his chief Maurice made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
peace at Passau, to allow all his <i>brilliance</i> to be rusted
for want of action. Peace to him was like a hard frost
to a fox–hunter. Besides his Protestant feelings were
very strongly stimulated by the contemplation of the
rich and very defenceless territories of those malignant
Papists, the Bishops of Bamberg and Würzburg.</p>

<p>So he refused to join in, or be bound by the treaty
of Passau, and determined to carry on the war on his
own account. Which he did after so brilliantly Ishmaelitish
a fashion, that a cry of mad dog was raised, and
he was put to the ban of the Empire. Being thus
driven from harrying the countries of the two prince–bishops,
and obliged to look round for some shelter
from his pursuers, he dashed at neighbouring Schweinfurth,
seized it as a stronghold for himself and his
troops; and was there besieged by the bishops, in
conjunction with the Nürembergers and the Duke of
Brunswick.</p>

<p>Which interrupted very disagreeably the morning
Homer readings and the evening Greek psalm–singing
in the quiet little home we were just now peeping into.</p>

<p>Deliration of princes indeed! Better, if fighting
must needs be, to have a quarrel of your own to fight
for, like the bold Magdeburgers, with Interim at their
gates! But these hapless Schweinfurth citizens had
their city turned to the uses of a badger–baiting tub
for neither fault, quarrel, nor interest of their own.
Let the upshot of the struggle be as it might, they had
only ruin and destruction to fear from it. And this
siege lasted for fourteen months! "For fourteen
whole months did we live in the greatest possible straits,
while the city was besieged;" writes Olympia to her
sister. "If I were to attempt to recount to you all we
went through, I should send you, not a letter, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
large volume. By day and by night we were in the
midst of the missiles of the besiegers." The lawlessness
of the troops within the town was a dreadful
addition to their calamities. The homes of the citizens
were constantly liable to predatory visits from bands of
soldiers, whose "bravery, adroitness, cruelty, thievishness,
and faithlessness" were quite as "brilliant" as
their master's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SIEGE.</div>

<p>In the ordinary and fitting course of things, pestilence
soon made its appearance in a city thus circumstanced;
and, together, with an excessive scarcity of
food, completed the misery of its inhabitants. It now
became Grünthler's duty to be found in the van of the
struggle, and in the hottest of the danger. And as
usual in the annals of a profession, which has, more
rarely, probably, than has been the case in any other
department of human effort, been found wanting in the
high estimate and full discharge of its duties in times
of danger and difficulty, the physician was early and
late at his post, struggling hand to hand with <i>his</i> enemy.
But the fight had to be carried on under great disadvantages.
All the stock of medicines in the town was
exhausted. And drugs formed a larger portion of the
means and appliances at the command of the skilled
physician in those days, than is now the case. The
sickness spread with fearful rapidity. "By contagion
among the soldiers," writes Olympia,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> "who are excessively
crowded in the city, so malignant a form of disease
has attacked almost the entire population, that
nearly one half of the people have perished, terror
and mental distress contributing no small part to the
result."</p>

<p>Before long Grünthler was struck down in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of his labours. Help there was none. Every man
was too much engrossed by his own desperate fight
with the misery around him. Medicine there was
none, food but little. And Olympia watched alone and
helpless by the bedside of her husband; sustained
only by the belief that her fervent and unceasing
prayers might move Heaven to that miraculous interference
with the unseen working of the material laws,
which even then mankind had ceased to expect in cases
where their operation is seen and comprehended.
Even Olympia, whose love for her husband poured
itself forth in such earnest supplications, that the fever
in his blood might not produce the effect upon his
organism, which in other men it did produce,—Olympia
herself would not have prayed, that water closing over
his head should fail to drown him.</p>

<p>Not the less did her belief sustain her in those long
hours of dreadful desolation and sickening dread.
She was comforted;—though at the cost of a lower
ideal of the nature of the Creator than she would have
attained had such comfort been impossible to her;
and, therefore, at the cost of a proportionate inferiority
in her own moral nature.</p>

<p>But the physician's malady was not "unto death."
He recovered. As M. Bonnet writes;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> "It required
a miracle to save Grünthler.... Olympia's prayers
and those of the Church of Schweinfurth were heard;
and Grünthler was saved!"</p>

<p>Amid the horrors of this time Olympia found means
to send out of the city a letter<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> to Lavinia della
Rovere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO LAVINIA.</div>

<p>"What a good fortune is it," she writes, "in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
misery to have found an opportunity of telling you of
our sorrows. Weep for us, my friend; hut at the same
time be thankful for our mercies. We are besieged in
this town, and shut in without escape, between two great
armies. But God has so kept us hitherto, that we have
escaped from what seemed certain death. He has fed us,
and continues to feed us, in a time of extreme scarcity.
My husband, prostrated by disease, was on the brink of
the grave. But He hath deigned to recall him to life in
mercy to me, who could not have supported so heavy a
blow.... In all these afflictions we have had but one
consolation, prayer and meditation on the Holy Scriptures.
Not once have I turned to look back with regret
on the riches of Egypt. And I have felt that to meet
death here, is preferable to the enjoyment of all the
pleasures of the world elsewhere." "Egypt," and
"elsewhere" of course mean Ferrara, with the necessity
of concealing her religious faith. She concludes
this letter, written amid so great misery, with a burst
of affection, which shows how deeply the friendship of
her early years had rooted itself in her heart, and how
profoundly she had felt the kindness shown to her in
her old time of distress.</p>

<p>"Once more, farewell! my own sweetest Lavinia,
who livest ever in my heart's core,—quæ mihi semper
hæres in medullis,—and whom I can never forget
while life remains,—dum spiritus hos reget artus.
Adieu! Adieu! and may you live in happiness!"</p>

<p>As the besieging forces, irritated at the length of
time the Margrave had succeeded in holding the town
against them, redoubled their efforts, the condition of
those within the city became continually worse and
worse. The houses no longer afforded the inhabitants
shelter from the fire of the enemy. "During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
whole of that period," writes Olympia to Curione,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of
the latter part of the siege, "we were obliged to lie
concealed in a cellar."</p>

<p>At length, Albert's means of resistance were exhausted;
and that "brilliant" specimen of chivalry
evacuated the town at the head of his soldiery, with
the intention of cutting his way through the besieging
forces. Great was the joy in Schweinfurth at his
departure; but it was of very short duration. For
while one portion of the allied troops pursued the
flying Margrave, the forces of Nüremberg, and of the
two Bishops, entered the town the next day, determined
to treat it as a place taken by assault. They
were all good Catholics, and the Schweinfurth people
were almost all Protestants, unarmed, worn out by the
long miseries of the siege, and much more than decimated
by the pestilence.</p>

<p>It was a good opportunity for indulging in every
evil passion, under the cloak of religious zeal. And
Schweinfurth suffered all the horrors of a sack, inflicted
in cold blood by fellow–countrymen, the citizens
of neighbouring towns, divided from their victims only
by some speculative differences of creed!</p>

<div class="sidenote">ESCAPE FROM THE CITY.</div>

<p>Olympia has recorded some of the incidents of that
dreadful day in the letter to her sister, that has been
already quoted. The soldiers, rushing into the town
in complete disorder, set fire to the houses in many
places. "In that moment of trepidation and panic
terror," she writes, "my husband and I were rushing
to the church as the safest asylum, when a soldier,
altogether unknown to us, addressed us, and warned
us to fly from the city if we would not be buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
beneath its ruins. Had we remained in the church,
we should have been suffocated by the smoke, as many
were. We followed the man's advice, and made for the
gate accordingly." But before they could reach it, the
letter goes on to say, they fell into the hands of a
party of soldiers, who stripped them of every thing,
and took Grünthler prisoner. Escaping from their
hands, he was a second time seized before they could
reach the gate.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> "Then, I can tell you, I knew what
agony of mind is, if ever I knew it; then I prayed with
ardour, if ever I did so. In my sore distress I cried
aloud, 'Help me! Help me, Oh Lord, for Christ his
sake!' nor did I cease my cry until He helped me,
and set my husband free. I would that you could have
seen in what a condition I was, covered with fluttering
rags, for my clothes had been torn from off my back.
In my flight I lost both shoes and stockings, and had
to run barefoot over rough stones and rocks, so that in
truth I know not how I won through. Again and again
I said, 'Here I must fall and die, for I can endure no
more.' Then I cried to God, 'Lord, if thou wilt, that I
live, command thy angels that they carry me, for carry
myself I cannot!'"</p>


<p>At length they reached the gate, and escaped from
the horrors of the town. "And having my husband
with me," says the letter to her sister, "I minded
not the loss of all else, though I had only my shift—subucula—left
to cover me."</p>

<p>In that plight, the fugitives had to travel ten miles
that dreadful night, till they reached the village of
Hammelburg. Olympia had been suffering the whole
time from tertian fever, and was absolutely unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
to proceed further. "Among the poorest of the
poor," she writes to Curione, "I might have been
taken for the queen of the beggars." At Hammelburg
they met with scant hospitality. The people were
afraid of giving offence to their prince–bishop by harbouring
fugitives from Protestant Schweinfurth. Nevertheless,
in the absolute impossibility of dragging herself
out of the town, Olympia and her companions were
allowed to remain there three days. On the fourth,
though still very ill, and hardly able to walk with the
support of her husband, the miserable wanderers were
obliged again to take the road. But they were still in
an enemy's country, and surrounded by danger. At
the next town they reached, they were arrested and
thrown into prison for several days, while the authorities
of the place applied to their superiors for directions
what was to be done with them. A general order
had been given to put to death all fugitives from
Schweinfurth; and these days were spent accordingly,
as Olympia says in the letter already quoted, in an
agony of hope and fear. They were at length released,
and met with assistance of some charitable individuals,
especially of one who, without allowing them to know his
name, gave them fifteen golden crowns,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> which enabled
them to reach the residence of the Count de Reineck on
the Saal. There they were kindly received, and assisted
to continue their journey to Erbach, in the Odenwald.</p>

<p>The Counts of this picturesque little mountain town
were at that time three brothers, who lived together in
the castle, which may yet be seen there; and the eldest
of whom had married the sister of the Count Palatine,
Frederick II., the principal builder of the magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
pile, still the boast and ornament of Heidelberg. They
were zealous Protestants, who had more than once
risked life and fortune in the cause, and enjoyed a
very high reputation for their piety among their co–religionists,
and even among their opponents, for their
virtues and uprightness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COUNTS OF ERBACH.</div>

<p>By these excellent men, and by the Countess, the
wanderers were received with open arms, and comforted
in every way that their miserable condition
required. Olympia was not unknown to them by reputation;
and the tale of sorrows she had now to tell, was
not needed to make her a welcome guest at Erbach.
She reached the hospitable roof utterly prostrated and
broken down, almost literally naked, and having lost all
that she and her husband possessed in the world.
Worst and most irreparable loss of all, her books,
those much–loved books, which had been the companions
of her life, and with them a great quantity of
her manuscripts, had perished in the burning of
Schweinfurth.</p>

<p>It needed all the motherly care and kindness of the
good Countess of Erbach, who insisted on ministering
to her as she lay on a bed of sickness for several days,
with her own hands, to restore her to some degree of
convalescence.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Indeed, the shock which her system
had received from the sufferings and fatigue of that
awful night during the escape from the city, and the
ten miles of weary wayfaring which followed it, was
ultimately, though not immediately, fatal to her. She
never recovered from the effects of it, though the
repose and kind cares of which she was the object in
the castle of Erbach, apparently restored her to some
degree of health for the present.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p>Olympia and her husband and little brother seem to
have remained some considerable time with these kind
and noble hosts. She had an opportunity of observing
the ordinary habits of their daily life, and has left us
an interesting little sketch of the patriarchal manners
prevailing in the pious household of a German country
nobleman of that day.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>"The Count," she writes, "maintains sundry
preachers in the town, and is always the first to be
present at their sermons. Every day before breakfast,
he gathers around him the members of his family and
his servants, and reads to them a portion of one of
St. Paul's Epistles. Then he kneels in prayer, together
with his whole household. His next care is to visit
his subjects, one by one, in their homes, when he
talks familiarly with them and exhorts them to piety.
For he says, that he is responsible before God for
their souls. Would that all princes and lords resembled
him!"</p>

<p>Of the Countess she writes to her sister, that "she
is a woman religious before all else. Her conversation
is ever of God and of the life hereafter, of which
she speaks with the greatest enthusiasm and desire."</p>

<p>Grünthler's friends were meanwhile endeavouring to
find some independent position for him. There is a
letter from one Hubert of Heidelberg to him, among
the collection of Olympia's letters,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> in which he tells
him, that all the councillors of the Palatine's court
being then at Worms, "seeking means to avert, if possible,
the calamities that menace Germany," he has no
immediate hope of being able to obtain for him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
chair in the University of Heidelberg. "But be
assured," he continues, "that my house is open to you
and to your family. Come to me without hesitation;
and be sure that better days are in store for you;—'Grata
superveniet, quæ non sperabitur, hora.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">TO HEIDELBERG.</div>

<p>But very soon after receiving this kind, though
unsatisfactory letter, Grünthler learned from the Count
of Erbach, that he had obtained for him the Professorship
of Medicine at Heidelberg from his brother–in–law
the Elector. Thus, once more there was an assured
life and sphere of duty before them; and taking leave
of their benefactors and the quiet mountain home
which had refitted them after the storm, they started
pilgrim–wise across the Odenwald, with full hearts and
renewed hopes towards their new home.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The distance to be traversed by the little family in
their journey from Erbach to Heidelberg, is about ten
leagues, through a country of wooded hills, then crossed
by no roads except the bridle–paths that led from village
to village. They were accompanied by guides
provided by their noble hosts at Erbach, and made the
little journey by easy stages. Their more pressing
necessities had been relieved by the generosity of the

schoolmaster at Mossbach, written to Curione at Bâle,

of this journey: The travellers had reached the little
town of Hirschhorn, in the valley of the Neckar, where
they were to pass the night. And there, in the common
room of the inn, were the schoolmaster of the place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
one Dominus Georgius Treuthuger, and his scholars,
practising part–singing in German fashion. The
"ludimagister" and his boys made, as it would seem,
but a lame business of it. Whereupon Olympia,
coming forward, helped them out of the difficulty,
singing the notes with them, and encouraging them.
Ludimagister Treuthuger was delighted, as he might
well be, at so charming a "Deus ex machinâ;" and,
entering into conversation with the strangers—in
Latin, of course—passed most of the evening in
learned discourse before discovering who the travellers
were. On learning their names, he rushed off to his
house, and returned with several pieces of Andreas
Grünthler's music, which had, he said, long been
favourites of his; "which infinitely delighted and surprised
the Doctor and Olympia;"<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> the surprise, it must
be supposed, being occasioned by the fact that Grünthler's
music should have found its way to the obscure
little town in the Neckar valley. "I have often heard
him," says Campanus, "telling his scholars never to
forget the lady who sang with them so beautifully, and
that at sight, too."</p>

<p>On the following day they reached Heidelberg safely,
and Grünthler at once entered on the duties of his
office.</p>

<p>Hubert Thomas, who was secretary to the Elector
Palatine, and a friend, as we have seen, of Grünthler
and his wife, has written<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> that a professor's chair of
the Greek language was offered to Olympia by the
Elector, at the same time that he appointed her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to one of medicine. He speaks of "Doctor
Andreas Grünthler, whose wife Olympia, to describe
her justly, should be called Sappho of Lesbos;" and
goes on to say, that "Both of them were invited by our
prince to be the ornaments of his University; he to be
professor of medicine, she to teach the Greek language,
which she hath hitherto deferred doing, on account of
ill health." M. Bonnet thinks, that this offer of a
Greek professorship must be deemed a mistake and
rejected as incredible, because Olympia does not speak
of it in her letters to the brothers Sinapi and Curione.
These letters contain, he argues, even the smallest
details of her life, and would not therefore have omitted
a circumstance of such importance. But these letters,
though containing many a little incident which happened
to be in the mind of the writer at the moment,
do not in any wise purport to give a journal, or even a
general view of the history of her life. And even if
they were of this nature, it appears to me far more easy
to imagine reasons why Olympia may never have mentioned
this offer, than to suppose that the Elector's
secretary, writing annals at the time the events were
passing,—(for the word "hactenus" in the passage
quoted, "quod hactenus distulit (Olympia) morbo comprehensa,"
joined to the date of her death, show that
the passage must have been written within a year, at
least, of the circumstances recorded) could either have
been mistaken, or have written wilfully what was false.
Olympia knew but too well that she would never be
able to avail herself of such a proposal. Her health
and strength had been too much shattered. Probably
enough, her reminiscences of public lecturing, and the
applause of large auditories, may have made the idea
of again presenting herself to such an ordeal altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
distasteful to her present tone of mind and feeling, even
had her health permitted her to hope that she might
ever again be physically able to do so. And she may
have felt, that to give the physical reason for refusing
to her kind friends, was to sadden them needlessly by
dwelling on a subject which, in all her letters, she
touches as lightly as possible; while to assign such a
moral reason as has been suggested, would probably
give rise to troublesome remonstrances and persuasions.
Besides, we have no apparent means of knowing that
she did not mention this circumstance to some one, or
to all of these friends. Curione's title–page to her
works expressly tells us that we have in that volume
the writings of Olympia, "quæ hactenus inveniri potuerunt."
Many of her letters may have been, and in all
probability were, lost. To set aside, therefore, the
direct assertion of a perfectly competent and perfectly
trustworthy authority, on no other ground than the
silence, on the subject, of these letters, seems altogether
unreasonable and contrary to every principle of historical
investigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREEK PROFESSORSHIP.</div>

<p>There is, then, I think, no reason to discredit the
assertion of Hubert Thomas, that a chair in Greek,
which she was so eminently well qualified to occupy,
was offered to Olympia by the Elector, who, finding
that this celebrated and highly gifted Italian woman
was to be his subject, and a resident in his capital,
probably thought that he could in no manner contribute
more to the renown and attractions of his University,
than by imitating a step for which Italy, the
great authority on matters of learning and literature,
had already furnished more than one precedent.</p>

<p>In a letter from Olympia to her sister, written immediately
after their arrival at Heidelberg, on the silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of which as to the Greek professorship M. Bonnet,
who erroneously supposes it to be written to Curione,
specially rests his disbelief of any such proposal having
been made, she thus announces to her correspondent
their new prospects.</p>

<p>"My husband," she writes, "has been called to
Heidelberg, where we now are, by the most illustrious
Prince Palatine, Elector of the Empire, to teach medicine
in the public schools; although in this time of
calamitous and turbulent tempest, arms are more in
request than science."</p>

<p>Yet, had it not been for the consequences of the
sufferings endured that fatal night of the flight from
Schweinfurth, the aspects of the life now before them
might have seemed brighter than any that had hitherto
been their lot. Heidelberg was at that time, perhaps
the most flourishing and important centre of intellectual
movement and learning in Germany. Its University
held the highest rank, and its professors numbered
among them several of the most distinguished names
of Transalpine Europe. A professional chair among
such colleagues was no mean promotion.</p>

<p>Next to health, the most irreparable loss in the
Schweinfurth catastrophe was that of the library. And
we find their friends exerting themselves to repair, as
far as possible, this disaster. By a singular chance,
one volume, the Lives of Plutarch, belonging to
their former library, was recovered to form the nucleus
of a new collection. It had been found among the
ruins at Schweinfurth, with the name of Olympia written
on the last page; and John Sinapi had the pleasure
of sending it to her with a letter of consolations and
exhortations to fortitude under the calamities to which
they had been exposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTER FROM CURIONE.</div>

<p>"Leave groaning," he says, "to those who have no
hope save in this world. Your treasure is in heaven,
where thieves cannot steal it, nor flames destroy it. Do
you not, like the sage of old, carry all your goods with
you,—your learning, your piety, your honour, your
virtue, and your attainments? What are material
misfortunes and ruin to such an one? 'Si fractus illabatur
orbis, Impavidum ferient ruinæ.'"</p>

<p>Curione, from Bâle, writes; "I send you, my dear
Olympia, the Homer you ask for, together with some
publications of my own. The book of the <i>Lamentations</i>
of Jeremiah you will receive from Frankfurt; and you
will all the more profitably study it, in the time of your
mourning for your husband's native city. It is for you
now to return to the studies which have been interrupted,
to produce something worthy of Sophocles,
and to obtain the laurel which has so long been your
due."</p>

<p>All such brave talk must have been received by
Olympia with a sad smile. For she felt surely enough,
that her laurel–seeking days were over, and knew well
that the night, "when no man can work" was coming
very quickly. And, indeed, one can hardly help smiling
now at honest Curione's expectation that "something
worthy of Sophocles" should be generated by
meditations on the Lamentations of Jeremiah!</p>

<p>But the misfortunes which had fallen on the learned
physician and his celebrated wife at Schweinfurth, had
attracted, it would seem, such attention, that others
besides their own private friends were anxious to contribute
towards replacing what had been lost. For we
find Olympia charging Curione with her thanks to the
eminent publishers, Oporinus, Hervagius, and Frobenius,
for the valuable presents of books they had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
her. The incident is a pleasing trait of the feeling
existing among the members of the guild of learning
in those old German days, despite the volleys of sesquipedalian
billingsgate, more or less ciceronian, with
which they assailed each other on most occasions.
And it is a proof of the high estimation in which
Olympia was held, and of the extended reputation her
name had attained.</p>

<p>Yet it was an uphill task, this recomposing a home
in a strange city; and Olympia, weak and suffering as
she was, had to busy herself with far other cares and
labours than such as had rivalling Sophocles for their
object.</p>

<p>One of her earliest letters from Heidelberg was to
her old master John Sinapi. "My husband," she
writes, "is preparing for his public lectures. I have
been excessively busy all day in buying household gear,
that we may be able to get into our new house."
Emilio too was fully occupied "in domesticis negotiis,"
assisting his sister in her preparations for recommencing
housekeeping, or he would write to his friend
Theodora.</p>

<p>Then, from this and other letters of the same time,
we find her much troubled on the subject of serving–maids.
Ladies suffering from the same vexations in
the nineteenth century, may extend their sympathy
across the chasm of three hundred years, from poor
dear Mrs. Blank in the next street, to poor dear Mrs.
Grünthler in her home at Heidelberg. They may,
perhaps, find materials for consolation in their torments,
from the discovery, that "the pitch to which things
have come now–a–days," had been arrived at three
centuries ago, by this monotonously trundling world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TROUBLES ABOUT SERVANTS.</div>

<p>"The weakness of my health," she writes to John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Sinapi, "has within the last few days compelled me to
engage the only woman I have been able to meet with.
She asks a golden florin a month, reserving too the
right to employ a portion of her time for her own
profit. Under the pressure of necessity I have been
obliged to submit. But all the wealth of Persia should
not induce me to keep her any longer. I throw myself,
therefore, on your charity for assistance. Do try, if
you can send me a servant of some sort, young or old.
I can give her five florins a year."</p>

<p>She had written to our friend Cremer at Schweinfurth
to send her a cook, thinking, that many women
might be found anxious to obtain some shelter among
those unfortunates who had been made destitute and
homeless by the destruction of that city;—"ex miseris
illis pauperculis et vagis Suinfordiensibus." But another
friend, only designated by the initial N.,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> writes
from that misery–stricken place, to say, that he finds it
wholly impossible to send her either an old woman, or
a girl,—"anum aut ancillam." All at Schweinfurth are
either dead or dying. "The mother of your former
maid Kungunga would come, but is laid up with fever.
Possibly she may come, should she recover."</p>

<p>We find our old acquaintance Barbara come to the
surface again, after the cataclysm which had submerged
so much that was more valuable. Barbara was willing
to return to her old mistress; but then those intolerable
"mores" do not seem to have been mended by
all that had come and gone since the quiet Schweinfurth
days. And this proposal, even in Olympia's
pressing need, seems to have been rejected. Though,
as she writes to Andreas Campanus, the schoolmaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
at Mossbach, she would rather be her own maid, than
put up with any such as were to be found at Heidelberg.</p>

<p>Are there no ladies recently come from their virtuous
shires to establish a home in the great Babylon, who
can sympathise with her? Heidelberg was the seat of
a brilliant court, and a large university. And, doubtless,
the abigails partook of the vices and corruptions
incidental to both these phases of social life. The
good "ludimagister" of Mossbach would have sent
Olympia his own maid under escort of the postman,
"cum tabellario," but that she too was down with sickness,
as indeed were also all the family of poor
Andreas.</p>

<p>So difficult a matter was it to come by an eligible
maid–of–all–work in the year 1554! These domestic
perplexities will, no doubt, be to readers of her own
sex, the one touch of nature that makes all the world
akin. But it may seem strange to them that Mrs.
Grünthler ("Domina Grünthlera," as friend N. at
Schweinfurth, writing on these household matters,
alone of all her other correspondents, addresses her)
did not communicate with other mistresses of families
on such matters, instead of always with the gentlemen.
It must be remembered, however, that Olympia understood
no German, and the ladies around her no Latin.
Unlike her friend Francisca, John Sinapi's Italian wife,
she had never thought it worth her while to acquire
the language of her adopted country; betraying, one
might fancy, thereby, some little pedantic affectation
of classicality, the lees of the old Grecian–virgin
nature. The result was, that when she wanted to
speak of the price of a gown, she had to talk unintelligible
stuff about "sestercium nummorum;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
when she wanted a maid, could only seek assistance
from bearded doctors as classical as herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER CHARITY.</div>

<p>Still, let any reader of an un–hero–worshipping turn
of mind take notice, that our Olympia is no subject for
quizzing of his, on the score of any such little eccentricity
of the spectacled Minerva kind. A passage in
the letter of N. of Schweinfurth proves,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> that the difficulties
of her ciceronian idiom did not prevent her
from visiting, and with her small means comforting
the misery in the poor–house at Schweinfurth, during
those fearful days, when every man's thought was for
himself; though she <i>did</i> call the place a "Zenodochia."
And when the "res angusta domi" was pressing her
so hard, that Grünthler had to borrow money to meet
the expenses of their first establishment at Heidelberg,
she still found means to think of the poor she had left
in miserable Schweinfurth. "If there is anyone in
your neighbourhood," writes poor Grünthler to his
friend the schoolmaster at Mossbach, "who could lend
me twenty golden florins, I would send him a gold
chain as a security, and would name a day for the
repayment of the loan." Yet it is about the same
time that "N." writes to say, that the poor she used to
care for, had been all dispersed at the time of the sack
and burning of the city, and it was impossible to know
what had become of them. But he promises that the
money sent shall be distributed in charity according to
her wish.</p>

<p>Yet despite small means, past losses, and domestic
troubles, a happy career of usefulness and honour
might still have been before Grünthler and his highly
gifted wife, if only the latter had retained sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
vital force to have rallied from the Schweinfurth miseries.
But the physician had the infinite pain of seeing
her fade and perish daily, amid the manifold manifestations
of the high place she occupied in the esteem
and regard of her contemporaries.</p>

<p>The Elector, failing in his wish that she should reflect
a lustre on his University by occupying one of its
chairs, had wished to attach her to his court, as lady
of honour to the Electress. But Olympia had had
enough of courts! In a letter written in the year
1554 to her old friend and playmate Anne of Este,
then Duchess of Guise, after regretting their total and
inevitable separation, and wishing that she could be
near her, she adds; "Not that I would again pass my
life in a court; for I might have done so here had I
wished it."</p>

<p>The same feeling is expressed in a letter to John
Sinapi, written during the first days of her residence
at Heidelberg. He had proposed again confiding his
daughter Theodora to her care. Her presence will be
in every respect agreeable, Olympia replies. Send her
at once, but not with any idea of her frequenting the
court; "for I purpose spending my days far from
courts." But she will do all she can for her; will take
her sometimes to the Countess of Erbach, where she
may become acquainted with the three charming
daughters of that excellent woman. She must bring
her bed with her, "for we are unable at present to buy
more beds, and they are extremely dear here." ...
"Salute from me all your family, and the licentiate
Faius, <i>if he has ceased to be a monk</i>."</p>

<p>In another letter to Chilian Sinapi, written about
the same time, she regrets her inability to give assistance
to some persons whom he had recommended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
her. She had already charged herself with the keep
of some utterly destitute poor; would fain do so for
all the ruined unfortunates of Schweinfurth, were it
possible. Poor Andreas Rosarius, the schoolmaster, had
written to her too to say, that he was in great distress,
and asked her whether there would be any chance of
his finding any lessons in Heidelberg. But Olympia
could give him no encouragement. There was no
opening for a teacher in Heidelberg. It would
seem that "professions were too full" in the world
before the nineteenth century, as well as servants
troublesome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER RELIGIOUS LETTERS.</div>

<p>These letters, from which a stray fragment of biographical
interest has been gathered here and there,
are mainly filled with fervent religious exhortations,
conceived in a spirit that can leave no doubt of the
heartfelt sincerity of the writer. They are for the most
part free from any advocacy of the more revolting
doctrines of Calvinism, and insist chiefly on the
vanity of earthly interests, hopes, and pleasures, and
the necessity of God's free grace, to enable us to
choose the better path. Those especially to her sister,
to Lavinia della Rovere, and to Anna d'Este, are long,
urgent, and affectionate exhortations to hold all things
nought for Christ's sake. They may be found at
length, translated into French, in M. Bonnet's work.
But it has seemed to me unnecessary to occupy the
present pages with any specimen of these writings,
inasmuch as any page of them, divested of the names
of persons and places, which mark their authorship,
would be absolutely undistinguishable from many
millions of pages which have been, and are still
being, written and printed on the same subjects. It
may be remarked, however, that the manner is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
that of the evangelical writers of the nineteenth than
of the seventeenth century. It is wholly undisfigured
by the undue familiarity, low imagery, and grotesque
phraseology, which often marked the efforts of writers
determined at any cost to rouse, at least, the attention
of their readers, if they could not carry with them their
intelligence.</p>

<p>As her health declined rapidly, she felt, and frequently
expressed, that desire to quit this world and
its toils, and to be at rest with God, which is deemed
by religionists of the kind called evangelical, to be the
most sure and satisfactory indication of a healthy and
desirable condition of soul. Thinkers of a different
class see only a proof of failing bodily powers in
those manifestations, which, to the former, are assurances
of increasing spiritual vigour. They find it quite
in accordance with all the recognisable operations of
the Creator, that in well–regulated minds the desire to
live should become weakened, together with the physical
incapacity for life; but wholly out of all analogy
with His government of the world, that man's highest
spiritual excellence should coincide with, or even be
compatible with, a diseased condition of the machine,
by means of which the spirit has to act and develop
itself; and still more, if possible, inconsistent with the
ways of God to man, that man's highest state of efficiency
for duty should be specially marked by his
desire to leave the scene of it.</p>

<p>Olympia's willingness to die, normally and mercifully
(a tautological expression!) accompanied the increasing
certainty that she could not live. It is true,
that the world around her, in all that most nearly
touched her affections, hopes, and fears, was becoming
from day to day more cheerless and distasteful to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
The prospects of the Reformers were every where
becoming more and more gloomy. Already internal
schism was vexing Rome's schismatics!</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTION INCREASES.</div>

<p>"I am not ignorant,"<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> writes Olympia to Vergerius,
"that a great controversy about the sacrament has
arisen among the reformed. But this would easily
have been put an end to before this, if men would
think less of their own glory, and more of that of
Christ, and the safety of his Church." Pope Paul IV.
would have re–echoed the sentiment with most entire
approbation!</p>

<p>Then, again, tidings of increasing persecution were
coming in from all parts. In England, Mary had
succeeded to the throne. And Olympia hears that
Bernardino Ochino, of Siena, has been obliged to fly
thence, and take refuge at Geneva. From France the
news was even worse and worse. From Italy it was to
Olympia the worst of all.</p>

<p>"My last letters from Italy," she writes to Chilian
Sinapi,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> "bring me the sad news that the Christians at
Ferrara—(this is not the only passage of Olympia's
writings in which she, by implication, denies that the
Romanists are Christians)—are suffering from the most
cruel persecution. The great and the little are equally
exposed to suffering for conscience' sake. Some are
loaded with chains. Some are condemned to exile.
A remnant find their safety in flight. My mother has
continued firm amid the storm. All honour be to
God therefor. I entreat her to come out from that
Babylon with my sisters, and to join me in this
country."</p>

<p>To complete the gloom of the material horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
around her, pestilence broke out in Heidelberg in the
early summer of 1555. And once again it became the
physician's duty to be found in the van of the battle
against it. Yet it was hard to be called on to leave
the bedside of his now evidently dying wife, at every
daily and nightly call. But he was strengthened in
the path of his duty by the exhortations of Olympia.</p>

<p>Bad news also came from Curione. Both he and
his daughter were struck down by illness. He recovered
shortly, however; and it would be strange, if
the inconsistency were not generic rather than peculiar
to Olympia, to observe, that she, who welcomed death
as a spiritual blessing to herself, and deemed her so
welcoming it to be a mark of spiritual grace, "wept
with joy at hearing that her friend had been snatched
from the tomb."</p>

<p>In the same letter<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> she writes: "As for me, my
dear Celio, I must tell you that it is hardly probable
that I should survive much longer. Medical treatment
can do nothing for me. Each day and hour my friends
see me perishing from before them. This letter is in
all likelihood the last you will ever receive from me.
My body and my strength are worn out. I have no
appetite; and I am constantly, night and day,
threatened with suffocation by my cough. A burning
fever consumes me; and pain in every part of my body
takes away the possibility of sleep. There is nothing
further for me but to breathe my last sigh. But up
to that last sigh I shall not forget those whom I have
loved. Do not let the news of my death afflict you.
I know that the reward of the just is reserved for
me; and I long to quit this life to be with Jesus
Christ."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">HER LAST HOURS.</div>

<p>A letter from Grünthler<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> to Curione, gives a detailed
account of her last hours.</p>

<p>"A short time before her end," he writes, "she
waked from a short sleep, and smiled, as if moved by
some pleasing thought. Hanging over her, I asked
the cause of this sweet expression. 'I saw in my
dream,' she said, 'a place illumined with the most
brilliant and pure light.'—(She had lucidity and clear
honesty enough to distinguish between 'dream' and
'vision.')—Her extreme weakness did not permit her
to say more. I said 'Courage, my best beloved!
Very soon you will be living amid that pure light.'
She smiled again, and made a slight sign of assent.
A little afterwards, she said, 'I am happy, perfectly
happy;' and ceased speaking, just as her sight began
to fail. 'I can scarcely see you, my loved ones,' she
said; 'but all round me there seem to be beautiful
flowers.' Those were her last words. An instant
afterwards she seemed to fall asleep, and breathed her
last."</p>

<p>She died, the same letter tells us, at four in the
afternoon of the 26th of October, 1555; having not
completed her twenty–ninth year.</p>

<p>Grünthler felt his loss to be the loss of all that
made life desirable to him. But he had not to endure
it long. The pestilence continued to decimate Heidelberg.
The University was deserted; and the town
was half emptied by death and by the flight of all who
could escape. But the bereaved physician had no
motive to shun the pestilence, even if his duty had not
been to remain in the midst of it. He continued some
two months at his post after the death of his wife, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
then struck down by the sickness, and so followed
her.</p>

<p>The boy Emilio, now in his thirteenth year, thus
left alone in the plague–stricken city, must in all probability
have taken the infection from his brother–in–law;
for he also died within a few days.</p>

<p>All three were buried in a chapel of the Church of
St. Peter at Heidelberg, at the expense of a French
professor in the University, one Guillaume Rascalon;
where the following inscription, recently restored,
M. Bonnet says, may yet be read:—</p>

<p>"Deo Inmortali Sacrum et virtuti ac memoriæ
Olympiæ Moratæ, Fulvii Morati Mantuani viri doctissimi,
filiæ, Andreæ Grünthleri medici conjugis; lectissimæ
feminæ, cujus ingenium ac singularis utriusque
linguæ cognitio, in moribus autem probitas, summumque
pietatis studium, supra communem modum semper
existimata sunt. Quod de ejus vita hominum judicium,
beata mors sanctissime ac pacatissime ab ea obita,
divino quoque confirmavit testimonio. Obiit, mutato
solo, a salute DLV supra mille, suæ ætatis XXIX.
Hic cum marito et Emilio fratre sepulta."</p>

<p>The citizens of Schweinfurth resolved that the house
Olympia had inhabited among them should be rebuilt
at the public cost, and marked out to the respect of
future generations by an inscription commemorative of
her having dwelt on that spot. The inscription is
indicative of the high esteem of the worthy burghers
for their celebrated fellow–citizen, rather than of any
æsthetic appreciation of her productions. For the
hexameters and pentameters into which Schweinfurth
has painfully packed its sentiments, are of a kind to
make the classical ghost of Olympia shudder, if that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
erudite and gentle spirit may be supposed to have cognisance
of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER HIGH REPUTE.</div>

<p>Olympia Morata had in the course of this short life
acquired a high European reputation. The loving care
of Celio Curione, the editor of her works, has collected
and appended to them, after the fashion of that day,
an abundant selection of the "favourable notices" of
her learned contemporaries. And M. Bonnet has
gathered some further testimonies to the same effect.
Many pages might be filled with the laudatory sayings
of these high authorities. But it will probably be
thought sufficient to state that the "eruditorum testimonia"
do certainly prove that Olympia was very
highly esteemed by the contemporary literary world of
Europe. The most compendious and undeniable evidence
of this may be found moreover in the fact, that
four editions of her works were printed within twenty–five
years after her death.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>To the present writer's thinking, the greatness of
this reputation must appear to us of the nineteenth
century a noticeable indication of a past and gone
phase of literary history, rather than as a result that
we should have anticipated from an examination of the
works in question. In Curione's dedication of the
volume to Queen Elizabeth, he says; "This book will
prove the marvellous knowledge of Olympia, her zeal
for religion, her patience under severe trials, and her
unshakeable constancy in adversity." Understanding
"marvellous knowledge" to mean very remarkable
accuracy of classical scholarship, it is true, that the
book <i>does</i> prove all this. And there is every reason to
think that nothing more would be proved if we were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
possession of those other writings whose loss Curione
and M. Bonnet deplore. "She had composed," her
old friend goes on to say in his dedication, "many
other writings which should have perpetuated the fame
of her faith and her talents, but which perished in the
destruction of her adopted country. That which
remains will suffice to give you an idea of that which
has been lost." In another passage of the dedication
he tells us what these were.</p>

<p>"She had written observations on Homer; she had
composed with great elegance many verses, especially
on divine themes; and certain dialogues, both Latin
and Greek had been elaborated by her with such a
perfection of imitation of Plato and Cicero, that
not Zoilus himself could have found any fault in
them."</p>

<p>There is no reason to doubt that, as Curione says,
the remaining writings give a very sufficient idea of
those which have perished; and as little to question
the very remarkable skill in classical imitation which
marked them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the world will hardly be persuaded
that it has sustained any loss by the destruction of
these once so much prized manuscripts. The loss of
the letters, which form the bulk of the volume that
good Curione's care has given us, would have been more
regrettable. These have still an historical interest,
as contributing many graphic touches to the picture
we are able to form for ourselves, of that complex,
seething, labouring time. It may be added, that
they offer also an ethical delineation which the world
has still a use for. These letters <i>do</i>, as Curione says,
show a lively picture of the writer's "zeal for religion,
patience under trial, and unshakeable constancy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
adversity;" one of these pictures which the world
cannot wisely allow to be effaced.</p>

<p>[Sidene: HER CLASSICAL SKILL.]</p>

<p>But it was not the manifestation of these fine qualities
which obtained for Olympia that great reputation
among her contemporaries which is itself an historical
phenomenon of no slight importance. It was not her
patience under trial, and constancy in adversity, that
caused Europe so to ring with her name that the echo
of it has reached these days. Fine and noble things as
these are, the world has at no time been so poor in
them, as not to have possessed many noteworthy examples
of them, which fame has had no time to note.
Olympia's reputation was due to her learning,
exclusive, be it observed, of any of the affectionate
sympathy with which she was regarded by her co–religionists
on account of her steady adherence to
her religious convictions. For Tiraboschi, Quadrio,
and other Romanist writers, while lamenting her heresy,
speak as warmly as any of her literary merits. Her
fame was the reward of such skilful "perfection in the
imitation of Cicero and Plato, that not even Zoilus
could pick out a fault in her compositions." Many
a scholar of mature age enjoyed the respect of his contemporaries
in that century, in virtue of a life spent
in obtaining that proficiency of which Olympia was
mistress in her teens. And though such an amount of
admiration for scholarship must seem strange and
excessive to an age which considers similar proficiency
in young gentlemen in their teens quite sufficiently
rewarded by the presentation of a handsomely bound
volume with some school–founder's arms stamped in
gold on the side; still it must be borne in mind, that
the difficulties overcome by the sixteenth century
young lady were of a very far more formidable kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
than those, which lie in the way of the nineteenth century
young gentleman. Corrupt texts, and scarcity of
them, inexperienced and but partially competent teachers,
unsettled and very little understood principles of
exegesis and criticism, the absence of all that luxury
of philological apparatus, which waits on the modern
scholar, made the path of the medieval explorers into
the jungle of the ancient literature, a very different
thing from that of the traveller along its roads, cleared
and embellished by the assiduous labour of three hundred
years.</p>

<p>Much indefatigable industry, many long and weary
hours passed in bending over books, while others were
spending youthful hours in youthful enjoyments, and
very considerable aptitude for appreciating the beauties,
analogies, and delicacies of language, must have
gone to the acquirement of that amount of scholarship
which Olympia possessed at sixteen. But the same
amount of industry and talent expended on any other
subject would not have produced any such meed of
enthusiastic admiration. And the position she occupied
in her own day, must be considered as a curious
indication of the avidity with which the cultivated
minds of Europe seized on the new field opened to
them, and seemed to think that it might be made to
yield all that the human intelligence was then thirsting
for.</p>

<p>But Olympia's classical successes, her Greek psalms,
her Platonic dialogues, and her Ciceronian Latin,
would not have made her more to the nineteenth century
than one of the remarkable figures in the great
picture of her time, worth preserving the outline of for
the sake of the completeness of the general representation.
And in truth she is something more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
this;—something more interesting to us, as a "representative
woman," than a miracle of scholarly learning,
an example of adversity nobly endured, or even a
sufferer for conscience' sake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOT SPOILED BY LEARNING.</div>

<p>The especial interest of Olympia Morata's story lies,
for us, in the very remarkable contradiction it gives to
the theories of those who object to learnedly—or as
the habits of our time unfortunately make it correct to
say—masculinely educated women. If ever there was
a case in which adventitious circumstances contributed
to bring about a result which would have furnished a
moral on the other side of the question, it was that of
Olympia. The advocates of the knitting needle and
Lindley Murray may well have thought that the case
was going all their own way, when that Greek verse
exultation over abandoned feminalities was declaimed
to an applauding court circle. Learning surely never
had better vantage ground for effecting the mischief
dreaded from it.</p>

<p>Yet how closely within call the while was all that is
most valuable and womanly in woman! How promptly
it was all forthcoming at the first touch of softening
sorrow, or the first awakening thrill of maidenly love—those
master agents in completing and perfecting
woman's moral nature! Did Olympia's learning make
her a less loving, or even a less housewifely wife?
Did her competency to correspond with the scholars of
Europe render her less capable of gaining the affection
of friends of her own sex? Her Homeric studies did
not keep her from visiting the poor in the plague–stricken
poor–house of Schweinfurth; or detain her
from her solitary watch by her sick husband's bedside.
No Ciceronian paradoxes were running in her head
when all her energies had to be devoted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
reconstructing her own and her husband's home in a
strange city; nor did love of study make her forget
that "a household was sure to go wrong when the
mistress's back was turned."</p>

<p>Vittoria Colonna was learned, and a good womanly
woman to boot, though she was far less learned, and of
far shallower moral nature than Olympia. But then
Vittoria was a princess, and therefore much less to the
purpose as a sample of the compatibility of high
education and intellectual pursuits, with the exemplary
discharge of all a woman's ordinary duties. Olympia
was the wife of a poor man, and one struggling with
difficulties of no ordinary kind. Yet it would be
difficult to imagine for him a fitter, more helpful, or
more wifely helpmate than Andreas Grünthler found
in his reclaimed "Grecian virgin."</p>

<h2 class="p4">ISABELLA ANDREINI.</h2>

<hr class="dec2" />

<p class="pn center">(1562.–1604.)</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">Italian love for the theatre.—Italian dramatic literature.—Tragedy.—Comedy.—Tiraboschi's
notion of it.—Macchiavelli's Mandragola.—Isabella's
high standing among her contemporaries.—Her husband.—Her
high character.—Death and epitaph.—Her writings.—Nature
and value of histrionic art.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Isabella Andreini, say her Italian biographers,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
was one of the greatest actresses who ever lived. She
was also a writer of dramatic and other works, much
esteemed by her contemporaries.</p>

<p>She was born in 1562, two years before the birth of
Shakspeare; and was therefore delighting the courts
of Italy and France at the same time that he was
catering for the amusement of a more mixed audience
at the Globe. It is true that Shakspeare is ...
Shakspeare, by virtue of his creative genius, and not
of his histrionic talent; while Isabella owed the larger
portion of her fame to the latter source. Besides, it
would be of course unjust to the Italian actress, as well
as preposterous, to dream of instituting any comparison
between her and nature's unique master–piece;
though her reputation among her contemporaries was
probably greater and more noisy than any which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
testified that the England of Elizabeth's time had a
suspicion that a poet for all time had been born among
them.</p>

<p>No such comparison is meant even to be hinted.
But the contemporaneousness of the English and
Italian dramatic artist suggests an inquiry into the
materials with which the latter had to work.</p>

<p>We know what quality of dramatic literature was
provided for the actors who plied their calling at the
Globe and the Bankside. And it is certain that no
one of them has left that histrionic reputation among
us which Isabella Andreini has left in Italy.</p>

<p>With this in one's mind, then, one is surprised to
find at the first glance that Italian literature in its
Augustan age was especially weak in the department
of the drama. Quite the reverse might have been
anticipated from the national characteristics. No
people are at the present day more passionately fond
of theatrical representation. The theatre is with them
almost a necessary of life to all classes of citizens, and
takes rank among the articles of an Italian's budget, if
not absolutely side by side with sufficient food, yet in
very many cases, immediately after it, and always has
precedence of very many matters that with us would
be considered necessaries. And the impressionable
nature of the people makes this very intelligible.
Every Italian is an actor more or less,—has a natural
talent for "externating" the feelings that are in him,
to use a very expressive Italian phrase,—a talent that
Englishmen are perhaps more deficient in than any
other people under the sun. To us how often is it
distasteful, how often impossible to "externare,"—to
make outwardly manifest—that which is inside us.
How frequently is the act of another doing so revolting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to us; especially in matters which touch the deeper
and more powerful sentiments of the heart! To an
Italian it is never either difficult or distasteful in real
life; and he is ever ready to sympathise with and be
pleased by a very moderate amount of histrionic skill
on the stage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITALIAN DRAMATIC LITERATURE.</div>

<p>It might naturally be expected that the dramatic
literature of a people so constituted would be a prominent
feature in the intellectual produce of the
national mind at its period of greatest vigour; and
would have exercised a notable influence in the moulding
and fashioning its habits of thought and turns of
expression. Such is, however, far from being the
case. The poets, the novelists, the historians, the
moralists of Italy in the sixteenth century time of its
high tide, have all left their marks deeply and visibly
enough stamped on the national character, while that
of the dramatists of the same period is barely, if at all,
perceptible.</p>

<p>It needs but a cursory examination of the Italian
drama of the sixteenth century, to remove all wonder
that its authors should have exercised no such influence.
The wonder is, that when literature in its other
branches was so vigorous and full of sap, drama should
have been so sapless and of such little worth. From
the earliest years of the sixteenth century there was no
lack of either tragedies or comedies in Italy. But the
mention of them and their authors would be little more
for the most part than a roll–call of names forgotten,
at least on our side of the Alps, and destined never
more to be remembered.</p>

<p>Tragedy was paralysed by the influence of the Greek
models, which the sixteenth century writers made it
their chief aim to copy. The servility of imitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
which was pernicious in every department of literature,
was fatal to that, which above all others needs to be
the expression of life, when it strove to force it into
the forms of a social existence long since dead. A
very cursory examination of the "Sophonisba" of
Trissino, of the "Rosmonda" and the "Orestes" of
Rucellai, or of the more celebrated "Canacci" of
Speroni—works which attained a higher celebrity in
their time than most of their contemporaries or followers—will
be sufficient to show why such productions
could never be to the Italians what the Elizabethan
dramatic literature has been to us.</p>

<p>As to comedy, Tiraboschi<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> complains that the comic
writers and actors of that period "strove to obtain that
applause which they had no hope of so easily gaining
in any other way, by a brazen–faced impudence of
words, gestures, and action; so that in those free and
dissolute times, it was too much the case that a comedy
was the more applauded the more filthy it was." And
Giglio Gregorio Giraldi (Olympia Morata's gouty old
friend) exclaims in one of his dialogues:<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> "O tempora!
O mores! Every abomination is again reproduced
upon the stage. Everywhere stories are represented,
which the general feeling of the Christian world had
rejected, banished, and abolished. And these are now
recalled and placed upon the stage by prelates and
bishops, not to speak of princes!" But a more cogent
reason why these indecent productions, as well as
those not deserving of condemnation on this ground,
could never have taken any real hold on the national
mind, may be found in worthy Tiraboschi's notion of
what was necessary to make such works all that could
be wished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">ITALIAN NOTION OF COMEDY.</div>

<p>"Comedy," says he,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> "the personages of which are
for the most part plebeian, or at least of private station,
and the action of which is generally familiar and
domestic in its character, is of its own nature low and
trivial. And if it is not sustained by a certain elegance
of style—which is all the more difficult to attain, in
that it must be natural—and by an ingenious, and at
the same time probable plot, abounding in movement
and surprising turns, it altogether falls to earth; and
it is almost impossible to endure either the representation
or the perusal of it."</p>

<p>The learned historian of Italian literature does not
seem to have the remotest suspicion, that a large and
deep knowledge of human nature, that the wide and
penetrating observation of its similitudes and dissimilitudes,
its contrasts, inconsistencies, and analogies,
which supply wit with its material, and the
genial power of sympathising with its thousand moods,
which generates humour, may be either necessary
or desirable to a comic writer. If Tiraboschi may be
accepted as spokesman for his countrymen in this
matter, we have an abundantly sufficient explanation
of the small share, which the Muses of the sock and
buskin have had in forming that portion of the
national mind which takes its shape from the national
literature, and to which their sisters of the Nine have
notably contributed.</p>

<p>But even comedy, though not in the same degree
as tragedy, laboured under the additional disqualification
inflicted on it by the prevailing mania for classical
imitation. In this case the model worked from was
Latin instead of Greek, and generally rather Plautus
than Terence. An instance worthy of note may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
cited in the "Sporta" or "Money–bag" of Giambattista
Gelli, the celebrated Florentine shoemaker, who
became Consul of the Academy of Florence. In the
prologue to this comedy he urges, in excuse for all
shortcomings, that "it is surely a wonder that he has
accomplished so much, having all day long to ply
scissors and needle, which, womanly tools though
they be, were never, as far as his reading tells him,
taken in hand by the Muses." Here we have a man
of the people, from whom some original conceptions
drawn from native popular life might have been
expected. But the shoemaker was as classical as
his superiors; and his "Sporta" is little more than
a disguisement of Plautus in Florentine costume.</p>

<p>Macchiavelli's well known comedy, the "Mandragola,"
is the most notable exception to what has been said
of the plays of Isabella Andreini's day. A genuine
type of character altogether belonging to his own time,
and full of the elements of high comedy, was embodied
in Frà Timoteo, the tartuffe monk, by the daring
Secretary. But it is an exception, which but proves
the rule.</p>

<p>What then are the sort of characters, in which we
are to suppose that Isabella produced an effect so
extraordinary? The testimonies of the extent of her
power over her audiences are abundant. Padua, her
native city, enrolled her at an early age in the list
of the "Intenti" academicians. Among these "Intent"
votaries of literature, her nickname, according to the
puerile practice of such bodies, was "l'Accesa"—"the
Inflamed one." The company of comedians, to
which she, and her husband Francesco Andreini,
also an actor and writer, belonged, were called the
"Gelosi"—"Jealous ones." So that Isabella's full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
style and titles, as they stand in the title pages of
her works, run thus; "Isabella Andreini, Comica
Gelosa, Accademica Intenta, detta l'Accesa."</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN FRANCE.</div>

<p>Her son, Giovanni Battista Andreini, himself an
actor and voluminous play–wright, has collected an
entire volume entitled "Apollo's Lament," composed of
the pieces of poetry by his mother's contemporaries,
written in her praise. Another numerous selection of
such tributes from most of the leading literary men
and women of that day written on the occasion of
her death, is prefixed to a volume of her poetry,
printed at Milan in 1605.</p>

<p>Having acted with the greatest applause before
most of the Italian courts, we find that she passed
with her husband's company of players into France,
where the "Gelosi" enjoyed under the patronage of
the French court a very high reputation, until
Isabella's death deprived them of their principal support
and attraction. A letter from Henry IV. is
recorded,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> in which he addresses her in the most
flattering and at the same time respectful terms.</p>

<p>A fine medal, not unfrequently met with in the
cabinets of collectors, was struck in her honour,
having on the obverse her portrait, with the words
"D. Isabella Andreini, C. G."—<i>Comica Gelosa</i>, that is
to say; and on the reverse a full length figure of Fame
with the legend "Æterna fama."</p>

<p class="b1">The celebrated Ericio Puteano wrote the following
inscription for her portrait.</p>

<p class="psq20">"Hanc vides, et hanc audis;<br />
Tu disputa, Argus esse malis ut videas</p>
<p class="psi20">An Midas, ut audias.<br />
Tantum enim sermonem vultus</p>
<p class="psi20"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>Quantum sermo vultum commendat;</p>
<p class="psi20">Quorum alterutro æterna esse potuisset,</p>
<p class="psi20">Cum vultum omnibus simulacris emendatiorem</p>
<p class="psi20">Et sermonem omni Suada venustiorem possideat."</p>

<p class="p1">"See her, and hear her!" as one may say; "and
then doubt, whether you would rather be Argus to
see the more, or Midas to hear the more. For face and
voice contribute equally to increase the bewitchment
of either. Both should have been eternal; for the
face was more perfect than any likeness can present
it, and the voice sweeter than that of Persuasion's
self."</p>

<p>Under another portrait was written; "You admire,
reader, this portrait of the histrionic Muse! What
would be your feelings, if you could hear her!"</p>

<p>The Cardinal Cinthio Aldobrandini, nephew of Pope
Clement VIII., wrote a number of poems in her
praise, and dedicated his works to her.</p>

<p class="b1">Franciscus Pola of Verona, and Leonardo Tedesco,
who wrote himself "physician and philosopher," made
Anagrams on her name, one discovering that she was
"Alia blanda sirena;" and the other questioning
whether she were "lira ne, an labris Dea." A panel
was painted with Isabella on one side and Pallas on
the other; and of course the wits discovered in verses
more complimentary to Isabella than to Minerva, that</p>

<p class="pn center reduct">"Utraque est Pallas, atq. Isabella utraque est."</p>

<p class="p1">Torquato Tasso wrote a sonnet on her; Charles
Emanuel of Savoy, admired and patronised her; and
she was generally spoken of as "Decoro delle Muse;"
and "Ornamento dei Teatri." Ventura of Bergamo
in a dedicatory letter declares that she "joined beauty
to propriety, freedom to modesty, excellent speech
with virtuous deeds, lofty intelligence with affable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
manners, and in short all that is most charming to
all that is most solid." Of Italy she was, he says,
"nothing less than the absolute queen, seeing that
she was the mistress (in no ill sense, <i>padrona</i>) of the
princes who ruled it." He adds that "the olive of
Pallas was on her lips, in her face the gardens of
Adonis, in her bosom the banquet of the Gods,
around her waist the girdle of Venus, in her arms
chaste love and the celestial Venus. So that one
must conclude," says this moderate gentleman, that
"she was the most choice product of all that the past
had brought forth, or the present was blessed with."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER HUSBAND.</div>

<p>But what is more satisfactory and remarkable is,
that Isabella's husband entertained as high an idea
of her merits as the rest of the world, and when he
lost her, was inconsolable. This Francesco Andreini
must have been a remarkable man in his profession
himself. He understood the French, Spanish, Polish,
Greek, and Turkish languages; and was the author of
various plays, dialogues, &amp;c. His professional nickname
was "Il Capitano Spavento," Captain Terror;
and his favourite parts, we are told, were swaggering
and braggadocio swashbucklers. But poor Capitano
Spavento had no more heart for the business after he
had lost his Isabella. His occupation was gone;
and the stage became distasteful to him. The troop
of the "Gelosi," went to the dogs, and he took to writing
instead of acting. In the preface to one of his books
he says; "after the death of my dearly loved wife
Isabella, I was advised by many of my friends to write
and publish something that I might preserve my name
from oblivion, and might worthily follow in the
honoured steps of my wife."</p>

<p>All this gifted woman's contemporaries are unanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
in testifying to her perfect propriety of
conduct. In an age when the relaxation of morals
was extreme and general, when princesses led the
lives of courtesans, when nunneries were scenes of
disorder, and princes of the church were noticeable
among other princes for greater dissoluteness, this
beautiful and universally flattered and courted actress
won her way through all the difficulties, dangers, and
snares that must have beset her path, without a stain
on her character. We know that much of what she
must have been obliged to touch, was pitch; and yet
she remained undefiled. Mazzuchelli writes; "what
was most remarkable in her was, that in a profession
universally judged to be dangerous to female honour,
she joined to a rare beauty, the most perfect correctness,
and a most blameless life." And he adds, oddly enough,
"the value of these good gifts was increased by her
skill in singing, and music, and by her knowledge of
Spanish!"</p>

<p>On the 10th of June, 1604, Isabella died in childbirth
at Lyons, in the forty–second year of her age, and
was buried by the municipality of that city with much
pomp, and all sorts of honours. Her husband placed
the following inscription over her tomb.</p>

<p class="pn center lmid">D. O. M.</p>

<p>"Isabella Andreina, Patavina, Mulier magnâ virtute
prædita, Honestatis Ornamentum, maritalisque Pudicitiæ

<p>In English, freely rendered—</p>

<p>"Isabella Andreini, of Padua, a most highly gifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
woman, the Soul of Honour, a model of conjugal chastity,
eloquent of tongue, fertile of genius, religious,
pious, beloved by the Muses, and a most distinguished
member of the histrionic profession, here awaits her
Resurrection. She died from a miscarriage on the
10th of June, 1604, in the 42nd year of her age. Francesco
Andreini, her deeply afflicted husband, placed
this monument."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHURCH BIGOTRY.</div>

<p>Bayle remarks on the close juxtaposition of the
statement of her profession, and her expectation of
resurrection; and observes that the circumstance may
serve to prove, that the severity of the Church on the
subject of the sepulture of comedians had been much
exaggerated. But it would be more correct to say,
that it proves the action of the Church in carrying out
its views and principles to have been fitful, irregular,
and subordinated to circumstances, as it in truth ever
has been. In the long, ceaseless battle of the Church
through century after century, against all that is not–church,
it has always known how to retire temporarily
from a point likely to be too hotly contested, without
by any means abandoning the hope of reconquering the
ground at a more favourable moment. Always pushing
on the advanced posts of its pretentions in accurate
correspondence with the amount of resistance it has
been met by, the polemical battle–front which it has
shown to its enemies from Pekin to Peru, has never been
straight drawn by the rule of immutable principles, but
ever a wavy line, with undulations constantly in movement.
And the startling fact that at Lyons, in the
year 1604, Isabella Andreini, avowing her calling, was
at the same time permitted to assert publicly, that she
hoped for resurrection to life eternal, shows only, that
so audacious a solecism was overlooked, because her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
standing in the public esteem, and the mood of
the Lyons world at the moment, made it unwise to
select that occasion for asserting the ecclesiastical
claims.</p>

<p>Isabella's published works consist of a pastoral
drama called "Mirtilla," written when she was very
young, and of which she herself speaks slightingly at a
later period of her life;—a volume of poems, some of
which are declared by Italian critics to have much
merit;—a collection of "Letters," (not real correspondence,
unfortunately, but essays written for the press);—and
lastly, some dialogues collected, as the title–page
tells us, by "Francesco Andreini, comico geloso, detto
il Capitano Spavento."</p>

<p>In a dedication of the "Letters" to the Duke of
Savoy, she says, that they are the fruit of long vigils,
and of hours snatched with difficulty from the avocations
of her most laborious profession, and that her
object in the composition of them was, as far as in her
lay, to preserve her name from oblivion after death.
With this view she has written some hundred and fifty
little treatises on such subjects as "The force of
friendship," "Of the constancy of women," "Lovers'
prayers," "Prayers of an honourable lover," "Of
jealousy," "Of marriage," "Of love and war," "Of
lovers' suspicions," and the like.</p>

<p>Poor Isabella! How desperately she must have
struggled during those long night hours, after the
labours of the day, against weariness and want of rest,
as she toiled on in pursuit of immortal fame!</p>

<p>A given number of hours on the treadmill would
probably be deemed by most extant men far more
endurable, than a similar number spent in reading the
pages thus industriously put together. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
if these sentences can help her on for a year or two
more in her fight against oblivion, she is heartily welcome
to the lift.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER IMMORTALITY.</div>

<p>The dialogues are on similar themes, and of exactly
similar quality. I have read one (being probably the
only living man who has done so), between Palamedes
and Cleopatra, entitled, "An amorous dispute respecting
a fainting fit caused by love." It is truly wonderful
to consider, that human beings, with minds similarly
constituted to our own, did read these writings with
admiration and delight! And when one looks on the
long, long road that human intellect must have travelled
over, since that was possible, one cannot but reflect on
the probability, that a yet more extended career must
lie before it.</p>

<p>These are the means by which the beautiful Isabella
Andreini sought to "avoid death," as she phrases it in
one of her prefaces, and to live in the memory of mankind;
means which have been successful, so far as to
insure the registering of her name in the folio pages of
those gatherers of literary crumbs, who have been
more abundant in Italy than in any other country.</p>

<p>But it is evident that in the day when she was really
famous, her fame was that of a great actress. Of all
the modes by which one mind may influence its fellows
and obtain their admiration, it has been said that that
of the histrionic artist is, from its nature, necessarily
the most evanescent and perishable. The poet's song,
the sculptor's statue, the architect's building, the historian's
history, the painter's picture, remain to us, and
their authors "being dead, yet speak" to after generations.
But the actor, whose immediate power over
his public is more intense, perhaps, than that of any of
these! His triumphs, however much involving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
necessity of intellectual power, having been achieved
by means of a perishable machine, are condemned to
be equally mortal. The only manner in which some
memory of his power, and some conception of its working
may be retained in the minds of men, is by attaching
his name to that of the characters he has represented.
It is thus that the great names of our own dramatic
annals have still a real meaning and significance.</p>

<p>But Isabella Andreini has left us no such memorial.
Of all the very numerous contemporaries who
speak in rapture of her performances, not one has recorded
a single hint as to the characters in which she
enchanted them. The omission seems a most singular
one, and can be accounted for on no other supposition,
than that the written words which the actress was to
speak were considered a comparatively insignificant
part of her performance: and the nature of the praises
lavished on her acting seem to point to the same conclusion.
We hear much of voice, action, grace, and
charm of elocution, but nothing of those higher matters
of histrionic art which raise it to the level of an intellectual
profession. Nothing is said of the effect produced
on the minds of the audience, nothing of conception
and interpretation of character, nothing of empire
over the sources of smiles and tears.</p>

<p>And these facts seem to furnish an explanation of
the difficulty of accounting for a great dramatic reputation,
at a time when dramatic literature was such as
has been described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TASSO'S AMINTA.</div>

<p class="b1">There was indeed one form of dramatic composition,
not properly to be classed with either tragedy or
comedy, that has not been mentioned. These were
the pastoral pieces, "favole boschereccie," poems rather
than dramas, of which Tasso's "Aminta" is the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
example, and to which Isabella's own "Mirtilla" also
belonged. From the circumstance of her having herself
written in that style, and more still from the high
place which the "Aminta" occupied in the public favour,
it may be deemed almost certain that the leading
actress of the day must have appeared in the part of
Silvia. The superiority of this charming little gem of
Tasso's to the generality of the contemporary dramatic
writings is very marked. But its charms, its idyllic
elegance, its Theophrastic echoes, its melodious verse,
are not dramatic charms. And though we may fancy
a beautiful woman, mistress of graceful elocution, and
skilled in drawing all its music from polished Italian
verse, uttering Silvia's disclaimer,</p>

<p class="pn center reduct">"Pianto d'amor non già, ma di pietade,"</p>

<p class="pn p1">with infinite charm of expression, still, any pleasure to
be derived from the stage presentation of such a poem
as the "Aminta," and any histrionic excellences to be
manifested by the exponents of it, must be deemed to
be of a very inferior rank indeed, to aught that modern
times have learned to expect from those whom the
world now considers great actors. And on the whole,
this record of a great Italian actress contemporary with
Shakspeare, must be considered to indicate that even if
the great master's works be left out of the question as
exceptional, drama stood higher, and was more appreciated
in the great sixteenth century among the "toto
divisos orbe Britannos," than in Italy, the metropolis
of literary culture.</p>

<p class="pbqi">The pretty version of the story;—and the true version of the same.—Saint
Mark's Square at Florence.—Bianca's beauty.—The Medici
<i>en famille</i>.—The Casino of St. Mark.—The Proprieties.—"Cosa
di Francesco."</p>

<p class="pn p2">In one of the twelve million volumes<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> of the Archives
of Venice, preserved in the two hundred and ninety–eight
rooms of the suppressed convent of St. Maria dei
Frari, there is one pointed out to our notice by the
learned and accurate Emmanuele<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Cigogna, in which
certain passages have been blotted out; and in the
margin opposite to them are written, in clerk's Latin,
the words, "Obliterated by order of the Council of
Ten." The volume in question is a register of criminal
processes before the court of the "Avvogaria" for the
year 1563. But the "Avvogadori" (members of one
of the numerous magistracies of Venice, whose attributions
were partly those of police magistrates, and partly
such as belong to a public prosecutor), in obeying the
commands of "The Ten," did not reckon on the lynx–eyed
curiosity of modern peerers into the secrets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
past. "As this obliteration," says Signor Cigogna,
"was not effected by the knife, but only by drawing a
pen with a different ink over the lines, the passages
scratched out have been very clearly decyphered by the
skill and sharp eyes of Signor Marco Solari, the paleographer."
And the secret, which the terrible "Ten"
thought to hide for evermore, thus divulged, and
stripped of its clerk's Latin dress, is to this effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SUPPRESSED PASSAGE.</div>

<p>"Whereas Pietro Bonaventuri of Florence, resident
in this city with his uncle Giovanni Batista Bonaventuri,
close to the church of St. Apollinore, hath
been accused before the criminal court of the Forty;
that with audacious insolence and disrespect for the
nobles of Venice, he, knowing that Bianca, the daughter
of Bartolommeo Cappello, was an heiress of no small
fortune, and thinking that he could get possession of
such property if he could in any way lead the girl
astray—(<i>si puellam ipsam aliquâ ratione falleret</i>)—dared
to take her from the house of her father in the
night following the 28th day of November, in the year
1563, having deceived her by many falsehoods, while
she has barely completed her sixteenth year, and afterwards
to take her with him from Venice, thus contaminating
the race and house of a noble Venetian, in
contempt of the laws, and against the public morals of
this city; and whereas the said Pietro, notwithstanding
diligent search, hath not been taken into custody, it is
ordered, that if at any time he shall be arrested, he
shall be brought to Venice, where, at the accustomed
hour, on a lofty scaffold erected between the two
columns on the piazza, his head shall be stricken from
his shoulders by the public executioner, so that he
die." Then follows the promise of a reward offered by
Bartolommeo Cappello, the father, in addition to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
promised by the government, to any one who will bring
in the body of the culprit, alive or dead, or give satisfactory
proof of having killed him anywhere beyond
the territory of the republic. Another long judgment
follows against those suspected of having aided the
couple in their flight, and specially against a certain
Maria Donati, "for that, being a serving–maid in the
house of the noble gentleman, Bartolommeo Cappello,
she perfidiously and audaciously dared, at the instance
of Pietro Bonaventuri, to give him her aid<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> in seducing
and enticing away Bianca, the daughter of the aforesaid
Bartolommeo, so that she not only had intercourse
with the aforesaid Peter, but fled away from her father's
house and from Venice."</p>

<p>Further, a MS. chronicle of the time, cited by
Cigogna,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> states, "that Bianca left Venice under a
disgracing ban, so that, if she returned, she would be
put to death."</p>

<p>These judicial records are terribly unmanageable
material in a biographer's hand. To think that a lynx–eyed
paleographer, by poking out one volume among
twelve million, and therein decyphering what was meant
to be concealed for ever three hundred years ago, should
have utterly spoiled for us the pretty romantic story,
with which Bianca's adventures have generally been
understood to commence. Romantic and despairing
passion of the young Florentine banker's clerk, shot to
the heart by glances darted across the narrow canal
from the noble palace opposite;—(alas! the same
detestable registers prove, that the Florentine bank
in which Bonaventuri was employed was not opposite,
but in a line with the Cappello palace, and out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
glance–shot;)—chance meeting at matins; imprudent
but innocent interviews at early dawn, with palace door
left ajar to secure the means of timely return; unhappy
stroke of destiny in the shape of the baker going his
early rounds, and, thinking to do well, shutting fatally
the half–open palace door, and cutting off all retreat
from the unfortunate maiden thus forced by terror and
despair to sudden and unpremeditated flight with her
lover:—all knocked to the ground like a child's card
house, by the interference of a lynx–eyed, dry–as–dust
paleographer!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRUE STORY.</div>

<p>So the Florentine banker's clerk was a vulgar
fortune–hunter, scheming to carry off an heiress!
Bianca herself was not only "no better," as the classic
phrase goes, but very perceptibly worse, "than she
should have been!"—(another MS.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> chronicle declares
that, being motherless, and not very sharply looked
after, she took to "freer habits of life than were usual
among noble Venetian damsels"). The flight from
Venice was a planned and got up thing, not unaccompanied,
say some<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> authorities, by a carefully–selected
trousseau of the family jewels; and the baker, unconscious,
but fatal instrument in the hands of destiny, a
myth!</p>

<p>All this pretty story, then, which shares with so many
others still prettier, the misfortune of not being in
accordance with fact, has to be regretfully abandoned.
Regretfully also must be sacrificed all the detailed
account of Bianca's journey with Bonaventuri to Florence,
with various adventures on the road,—hiding at
Ferrara, and narrow escape there from the secret emissaries
of the republic, &amp;c. &amp;c., which adorns the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
or less fictitious accounts of the matter, that have been
written in great number upon the "romance of history"
plan. All these things may have happened; but
unhappily there is no authority for saying that they
did so.</p>

<p>A poor fact–bound biographer, therefore, having due
fear of Dryasdust before his eyes, finds himself obliged
to shape his statement in this fashion.</p>

<p>One Pietro Bonaventuri, a young Florentine, employed
in a Florentine bank at Venice, found the
means of becoming acquainted with Bianca, the
motherless daughter of the noble Bartolommeo
Cappello, a young lady then in her sixteenth year,
but already noted for conduct none of the strictest;
and noted also as the heiress of a considerable fortune.
Giving her falsely to understand, as there is reason to
believe,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that he was a member of the great Salviati
family, Bonaventuri induced her to accord him secret
meetings, and continued this intercourse till Bianca
found herself to be with child. The couple thereupon
determined on a secret flight to Florence, there to be
married. And they did accordingly leave Venice on
the night of the 28th of November, 1563; and did
succeed, notwithstanding condemnation to death and
large rewards for their apprehension, in reaching
Florence in safety.</p>

<p>That the journey was one of difficulty and danger,
may also be asserted without fear of error; for the
roadless Apennine had to be crossed; it was winter;
and the sixteen–year–old fugitive was not in a condition
to perform such travel safely. But we get no distinct
sight of the pair, from the time of their flight on that
29th of November, till we find them married and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
lodged in comparative safety in the poor dwelling—"tugurio"—of
the bridegroom's mother in the Piazza
di San<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Marco at Florence. In comparative, but by
no means in absolute safety. For the Queen of the
Adriatic had long arms, and, as treaties of extradition
had not then come into use, it was a common practice
for rulers to execute by the hand of a hired assassin
in a foreign country, the sentence, which the culprit's
flight made it impossible for them to carry out more
regularly at home. Assassinations were extremely
common then in the streets of Florence; and the
"brave ones," whose trade it was to commit them,
were not likely to neglect so good a job, as that
commissioned by the "most Serene" Republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIAZZA DI SAN MARCO.</div>

<p>So Bianca and her husband had to keep themselves
close prisoners in the little house in the square of
St. Mark. She had found out by this time, that he
was no Salviati, but a poor clerk, now without a
clerkship. And he had found out, that he had
calculated amiss on those six thousand crowns, which
Bianca inherited from her mother, and which, according
to the Venetian law–records, had been to him the
maiden's chief attraction. For the Republic declared
them to be confiscated! A state of things not calculated,
it may be feared, to conduce to that mutual
affection, which must have been so necessary to make
their misfortunes, and imprisonment in the little
"tugurio," endurable.</p>

<p>But while they were thus courting obscurity the
story of their flight was making much noise in Italy.
The abduction of a Venetian noble's heiress was a
serious thing. All Venice felt the insult; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
reward for Bonaventuri's head was published in every
city. It thus came to pass, that Francesco, Duke
Cosmo's eldest son, the heir apparent to the throne of
Tuscany, heard the story, and, at the same time, that
the fugitives were then in Florence. And as rumour
was also saying extraordinary things of Bianca's
beauty, he conceived a strong desire to see the heroine
of the story.</p>

<p>All the contemporary writers speak much of this
same beauty and fascination; but it must be admitted,
that the portraits and medals, which remain to show us
what she really was, do not by any means confirm
their praises. It is true, that these representations of
her show her to us at a later period of her life, and
that the coarse strongly marked features may well
have been less repulsive at sixteen. Montaigne, in
the course of his tour in Italy, saw her at the Tuscan
court, and has written that she was "handsome,
according to the taste of the Italians, having a cheerful
and plump face, considerable stoutness of person, and
a bosom such as they admire." This description of
her face tallies very well with the portraits, and
specially with a medal which must have been struck in
her later years. It is a face well calculated to express
jovial, convivial cheerfulness, but coarse, vulgar, and
insolent in the extreme. And to this must be added,
hair, which only a courtier's flattery could term
"auburn," and an ungracefully stout person. This,
however, as Montaigne hints, is not in Italy thought
as incompatible with beauty as on this side of the
Alps; and hair, that we should term decidedly red, is
often much admired among the Italians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MEDICEAN TRAGEDY.</div>

<p>Francesco was at the time of Bianca's arrival in
Florence, in his twenty–third year, and, as far as can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
be judged from the reports of the contemporary
writers, had up to that time distinguished himself
rather as a reader and student than in any less
creditable way. The Court of Cosmo, however, was
by no means a favourable school for the education of
his children. Some of the scenes recorded by contemporary
writers as having been witnessed there are
of a nature wholly irreproducible here. And in the
last year before that of Bianca's arrival at Florence,
the year 1562, had occurred one of those horrible
domestic tragedies, which seem to have been a peculiar
specialty of the Medicean race.</p>

<p>Cosmo's two sons, Giovanni and Garzia, the former
nineteen and a cardinal of two years' standing, and
the latter fifteen years of age, were hunting together
near Leghorn. Some dispute arose respecting the
sport, on which the younger brother gave the elder a
mortal wound with his rapier. Giovanni died at
Leghorn. Garzia presented himself before his father
to implore his pardon for the crime; and was killed by
a similar wound from his father's sword, as he knelt
at his feet! Of course other and unexceptionably
legitimate causes were found and published to account
for both deaths. All which the respectable classes
pretended to believe; but jotted down their own
notions of the matter in "ricordi," destined to be
safely buried in the family muniment rooms; but
destined also to infallible resurrection at the summons
of inevitable Dryasdust. While the unrespectable
classes noted to each other under their breath, that
the bodies of the two princes had not been exposed to
the public view, as was the often inconvenient custom
with regard to dead highnesses; and muttered their
conclusions accordingly. The mother of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
princes, Eleonora di Toledo, died of grief as was
supposed, and as might well be, in the same year.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the more consolable father, having
given in marriage to a scion of the noble family of
Panciatici his mistress, Eleonora degli Albizzi, whom
her noble father had sold to him, asked another noble
father of Florence for his daughter, the beautiful
Camilla Martelli, to be her successor. The honour
was of course gratefully accepted by the proud patrician,
and Camilla Martelli became the mother of
Virginia de' Medici in 1568. But soon afterwards the
lady began to be troubled with scruples of conscience,
and consulted his Holiness, Pius V., upon the subject,
who counselled <i>patience!</i> meaning that she should
wait and see whether the sovereign might not be
induced to marry her. And accordingly as it happened,
that state reasons made it desirable for Cosmo
to conciliate the pontiff, he decided on gaining his
heart entirely by marrying "La Martelli" in 1570, and
by giving up to the Church his subject Carnesecchi, to
be burned as a heretic.</p>

<p>The other members of the family at the time of
Bianca's arrival in Florence, were Ferdinando, the
second surviving son of the grand duke, who at the
age of fourteen had just been made a cardinal, and who
was generally at Rome; Pietro, a third son, aged nine;
and Isabella, Cosmo's daughter, who had been married
to Paolo Giordano Orsini in 1553. She was, we are
told, the life and brightest ornament of the Tuscan
court. She had refused to follow her husband to
Rome; and as Cosmo had supported her in her
refusal, so far as manifesting his wish that she should
continue to reside in Florence, Orsini had left her
there, while he remained in his own city, and rarely or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
never troubled his wife, who had no love for him, with
his presence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASINO OF ST. MARK.</div>

<p>Such were the members of the Tuscan court in
1563–4; when Francesco determined to gratify his
curiosity by getting in some way a sight of the beautiful
stranger in Florence, who had been so much
talked of. It was not very difficult to accomplish this.
Somebody was found to suggest to Bianca and her
mother–in–law, that they would do wisely to seek an
interview with the Marchesa Mondragone, the wife of
Francesco's Spanish tutor, who might very easily
induce the prince to obtain from the Republic of
Venice a pardon for her husband and herself. The
bait was readily taken, and they were told that the
Marchesa would receive them in the Casino of S. Marco.</p>

<p>This small but remarkably elegant building, rebuilt
as it now stands in 1775 by the Grand Duke Pietro
Leopoldo, can hardly fail at the present day to attract
the attention of any stranger passing through the
Piazza of St. Mark. It was then a casino belonging to
the Medici; and is still the property of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany. A "casino" was an important
portion of the social arrangements of those days. A
"little house" for the transaction of such matters as
the "convenances"—Anglice hypocrisies—did not
allow of being conveniently carried on in the large
house, which was the noble family's residence, was
found to contribute very essentially to the maintenance
of that propriety, which is so dear to a people to whom
seeming is ever more important than being. Most of
the wealthier members of the aristocracy had such conveniences,
and the proprieties of Italian life would hardly
have been by any possibility maintained without them.</p>

<p>Now this casino of the young Prince Francesco was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
as has been seen, very near the humble dwelling of
Bianca. The "tugurio" of her husband was on the
south side of the small square facing St. Mark's church,
and the Prince's casino at right angles to it on the
west side—not a stone's throw distant. So that Bianca
and her mother–in–law were able to wait<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> on the kind
Marchesa there, with very slight departure from their
rule of not quitting the shelter of their home.</p>

<p>The Marchesa Mondragone received them with the
utmost affability; inquired with most amiable interest
into the particulars of Bianca's story; and, when it
chanced that her husband the Marchese entered the
room, she seized the opportunity of at once interesting
him in the case. The affability of the Spaniard
exceeded even that of his wife. He had not the least
doubt of being able to induce his Excellency to use
his influence with the Republic;—she might consider
the matter as good as settled. Then the Marchesa
suddenly bethought herself that she wanted to know,
whether some dresses of hers were made in the right
Venetian fashion. Would Bianca come with her and
look at them, while the Marchese did himself the pleasure
of remaining with the Signora Bonaventuri. So
Bianca was walked off into another room with her
charming new Spanish friend, who, after showing her
some of those matters, which women, it seems, used
to find amusement in looking at some three hundred
years ago, under pretence of seeking keys to open
other cupboards, or something of that sort, slipped
away, leaving her guest alone, but fully occupied in
admiring the profusion of magnificence that characterised
the apartment she was in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE INTERVIEW.</div>

<p>In another minute a curtain was raised from before
an opposite door, and Bianca found herself alone with
Francesco. The details of what passed at that first
interview between these two persons, who for the
remainder of their lives were to exercise so strange
and so pernicious a reciprocal influence, are recorded
by more than one writer.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Yet it is little likely that
either of them should have afterwards repeated the
mere matters of course proper to "the situation,"
which are set down as having been uttered by them.
It is true, that "La Mondragone" may be well supposed
to have been watching the happy progress of
her handiwork within ear–shot. The only circumstance
at all worth noting of all that is said to have
passed, whether true or fictitious, is that Bianca is
stated to have at once comprehended on seeing the
Prince what his errand was, and the whole motive with
which she had been induced to visit the Marchesa.
She pleaded for "<i>her honour!</i>" He assured her
that it should be abundantly cared for, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Whether the relationship in which they were thereafter
to stand towards each other was finally settled
there and then, or whether other such interviews were
required for the completion of their arrangements
does not appear. It was needful, it seems, even at
Florence in 1564, that some regard should be paid to
appearances by a prince in Francesco's position just
at that time. A marriage was being arranged for him
with Joan of Austria, daughter of the Emperor
Francis, which was eventually celebrated in December
1565. And the German "barbari" might have taken
offence if the prince's wooing of his wife and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
mistress had been too openly simultaneous. It would
have been <i>indecent</i>—would not have looked well, which
was, above all things, what was needful. Francesco
too was in that same year, 1564, entrusted with the
reins of government by his father, who, though he did
not formally abdicate the throne, yet left thenceforward
all the management of State matters to his son.</p>

<p>So that under the circumstances the left–handed
wooing had to seek for awhile the shelter of the
Casino;—furnishing thus an excellent illustration of
the utility of that convenient institution.</p>

<p>All then that the secrecy of that retreat has permitted
us to know with certainty as to the duration of
Bianca's resistance to the Prince is comprised in the
fact, that everything was satisfactorily arranged between
them within six months of her arrival in Florence.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
And as after that arrival she gave birth to a daughter,
named Pellegrina, it must be concluded, that no very
great length of time was consumed in coming to an
understanding.</p>

<p>And here it may be clearly stated that this was, as
far as can be gathered from the writings of her innumerable
abusers, Bianca's last fault <i>of this sort</i>. For
the rest of her days she seems to have been perfectly
faithful as mistress and as wife to Francesco. It is,
perhaps, the only one word we shall have an opportunity
of saying in her favour;—so mercifully inclined
readers may make the most of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COSA DI FRANCESCO.</div>

<p>But, by the bye, the lady's husband! He seems to
have been rather forgotten by us. But so he is also
by the original tellers of the story. None of them
hints a doubt of the possibility of his making any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
difficulty in the matter. We are shortly told, that
the gracious sovereign appointed him to a place of
"guarda–roba," some keeper of property of some sort.
So things were made pleasant to all parties; and the
adventurous banker's clerk made no difficulty in
admitting that his wife was henceforward, as the
chroniclers phrase is, "cosa di Francesco;"—goods
belonging to his Highness.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Whatever considerations of decency may have at
first thrown some measure of concealment around
Francesco's connection with Bianca, their operation
lasted but a very short time. The unfortunate Giovanna
very soon found, not only that the place, which
she should have occupied in her husband's affection,
was already given away to another, but that most even
of the external tokens of respect and homage which
belonged to her position were usurped by the same
audacious rival. The ascendancy exercised by Bianca
over the weak mind of Francesco soon began to make
itself manifest. It seems to have been at an early
period of their connection, that she induced him
solemnly to promise, "before a sacred image," that
should a time come, when they should both be free,
he would marry her. The promise originally made,
that Francesco should use his influence to obtain the
reversal of the sentence passed by the tribunals of the
Republic against Bianca and her husband, was also
duly performed, but ineffectually. The Senate of
Venice refused either to pardon the culprits, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
restore the six thousand crowns of Bianca's inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CASSANDRA RICCI.</div>

<p>One, who stood in the envied and distinguished
position of Bonaventuri, however, could easily dispense
with his wife's fortune. The husband of the sovereign's
mistress was in no great want of six thousand crowns.
Bonaventuri became, naturally, one of the distinguished
members of the Florentine "jeunesse dorée;"
and soon showed himself fitted by nature to shine in
such society, despite his clerkly bringing up.</p>

<p>There was at that time among the ornaments of the
society of Florence a young and beautiful widow,
Cassandra Bongianni; who was well inclined to avail
herself to any extent of the freedom from restraint
such a position secured to her. But Cassandra
Bongianni had been "nata" Cassandra Ricci, and
that proud and powerful family had intimated to the
gay widow their intention not to permit any scandal to
be cast on the family name by irregularities of hers.
And the warning had been already significantly enough
enforced by the assassination of two pretenders to the
widow's favour. A Cavalcanti<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and a Del Caccia had
fallen in the dangerous pursuit, stabbed in the streets
of Florence. Here then was an enterprise worthy of
the new aspirant for fashionable distinction. Perhaps
he imagined that two murders committed unavailingly
might have induced the Ricci to abandon the task of
protecting their kinswoman's fair fame at such a cost.
Still more probably he relied on the protection of court
favour. In any case he became the known lover of
the dangerous widow.</p>

<p>But one night<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> as he was returning to his home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the Via Maggio, accompanied by two servants, he was
assailed by twelve men at the foot of the Trinity
bridge, over the Arno, which he had to pass. One of
the servants fled; the other was struck down dead at
the first onset. Bonaventuri however succeeded in
fighting his way across the bridge, killing one of his
assailants, and was near his own house, when he fell,
and was dispatched by the daggers of the Ricci bravos.</p>

<p>Such an occurrence in the streets of Florence was
very far from rare. An hundred and eighty–six
assassinations took place within the city in the first
eighteen months after the death of Cosmo.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> So the
death of the favorite's husband excited but little notice.
The murder of Cassandra in her bed on the same
night by certain masked men, who entered the chamber
and performed the execution as quietly as if it had
been a judicial sentence, was more notable. But she
had had her two previous warnings; and the "honour"
of the Ricci family was thus made safe.</p>

<p>Bianca demanded from the duke vengeance on her
husband's murderers; and it was promised. But the
measures taken for that purpose were so evidently such
as to give the culprits every facility for escape, that
public opinion accused Francesco of having been privy
to the crime. And it is asserted that he confessed as
much to a certain court chaplain,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> one Giambattista
Confetti. But if, as seems probable, this was really
so, it is difficult to suppose, that Bianca was not equally
an accomplice before the fact in the murder. The
demand for justice was a matter of course. Not to
have made it, would have almost amounted to an
avowal of at least approbation of the deed. The complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
subjection of Francesco's mind to his mistress,
makes it exceedingly improbable that he would have
connived at such a design without imparting it to her.
And the only motive, that either of them could have
had for such a crime, beyond the possible wish to get
rid of one whose excesses and ill–conduct threw scandal
on his connection with the court, must be sought in
that promise, which Bianca had extorted from the
Duke, to take effect in case they should both be freed
from the bonds of marriage. The removal of Bonaventuri
overcame what was likely otherwise to have
proved the more insuperable obstacle to this event.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUCHESS GIOVANNA.</div>

<p>For the unhappy Giovanna, crushed beneath the
audacious effrontery of her rival, languishing from the
neglect and open indifference of her husband, solitary
and apart amid the festivities of a court, whose loose
morals were to her Austrian correctness an abomination,
and whose recent sovereignty her Austrian pride
despised; the mother of daughters only to her husband's
great regret, and increased dislike; of unamiable,
reserved manners, and of unlovely appearance,—this
unhappy Giovanna might very possibly, (even without
any assistance from such means as both Francesco and
Bianca knew very well how to avail themselves of, if need
were,) not continue long to be an obstacle in their way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young Princes Ferdinando and
Pietro were becoming of an age to exert an influence
on the family history and fortunes. Ferdinando the
Cardinal, had lived chiefly at Rome. At an early age
he had already acquired the reputation of a well
educated and well informed man, a dexterous and
prudent statesman, and a well–intentioned and respectable
prince.</p>

<p>Respectability, though many people are inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
deem it a specially British production, is yet now as
three hundred years ago far more specially an Italian
virtue. No people in the world care so much what is
said of them by those around them. It is true that
much is respectable there, which would not be able to
be respected here. But this is only because all Italian
society is more fully and unanimously agreed on considering
that seeming is more important than being.
With us, respectability must have no chinks nor
crannies in its surface, through which peering eyes can
discover anything derogatory to its character. But
the Italian world declines to peer. Let only a good
will to show a fair outside be apparent, and the world
will industriously avoid looking beyond that outside.
The state will overlook your breaking the laws if you
will seem to respect them. The Church does not
mind your infidelity if you will make believe to believe.
Society will take no notice of your neglect of social
duties, if you will not fling your defiance in its face.
Break the commandments as much as you will. But
observe the "convenances" religiously.</p>

<p>Now Ferdinando was above all a respectable prince,
holding an eminently respectable position; and it was
his great misfortune to have two brothers, who were
both audaciously, though in different degrees, and
according to their different natures, the reverse.</p>

<p>Francesco, his eider brother, assuredly did not fail
in achieving respectability from any too great openness
or sincerity of character. For a more dissembling
nature has rarely perhaps existed. His hypocrisy
frequently exhibited itself in traits of so strangely
profound a kind, as to have the appearance of a hope
to deceive either himself or his Creator. For he
would practise them upon his own confederates in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
crime. Nor was ever any one less indifferent to the
estimate his fellows might form of him. The honour
of the Medicean name, as he understood the meaning
of that phrase, was very dear to him. Yet he made
himself the common fable of the courts of Italy. He
contrived to earn the contempt of every crowned head
in Europe; and was constantly giving rise to that
"scandal" which is a respectable Italian's greatest
horror. Strong passions, and an obstinate will exaggerated
by the possession of absolute power into
something at times very like partial insanity, joined to
great weakness of all the higher intellectual faculties,
and a profound ignorance of the nature, beauty, and
value of real worth and nobleness, led him into all this
mischief, and were a source of never–ending sorrow
and trouble to the Cardinal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIETRO DE' MEDICI.</div>

<p>Pietro, the younger brother, was almost an equal
thorn in his prudent and respectably ambitious
brother's side. His was a nature as unlike as possible
to that of either the Duke or the Cardinal; and was
not without some indications, that under better circumstances,
it might have contained in it the elements
of a finer character than either of theirs. As it was,
Pietro was an unmitigated and avowed scamp; the
centre and leader of all the most profligate young men
in the city; the terror of quiet citizens, the insulter of
the impotent laws which he braved, the despair of the
Cardinal as a disgrace to the family, and the dread of
the Duke from his constant and insatiable demands
for money.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Cosmo, the old duke, died in 1574; but before he
went, he provided his scapegrace son with a wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
after a fashion, which unfortunately had not the effect
of reclaiming him from his wild courses. There was
living in the court a certain Eleonora di Garzia, a
niece of Cosmo's first wife, Eleonora di Toledo. She
was pretty, and pleased Cosmo's eye. But being of a
noble Spanish family, with interest at the Spanish
court, the "convenances" had to be assiduously
attended to. So when it appeared one day that
Eleonora was likely to become a mother, the exemplary
sovereign and excellent father, suddenly
struck with the idea that marriage was just the thing
to steady his runagate son Pietro, handed over the
lady to the young man, and bade him marry her.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
Pietro obediently did so; and the lady's "honour,"
and Cosmo's "honour," and the Toledo family
"honour" was all "saved" as bright as ever; which
was wholly satisfactory to all those honourable persons.
But beyond this very desirable result, the well–imagined
arrangement was not found to answer. Pietro led a
worse life than ever; and Eleonora had no inclination
to be a faithful wife to a husband she rarely saw.
But Cosmo went to his grave under the dome of
St. Lorenzo, with his honour saved, and left his
fatherly management to work to what results it might.</p>

<p>There were thus five ladies belonging to the Medicean
family party at the time of Cosmo's death. 1.
His widow Camilla Martelli. 2. Francesco's wife,
poor Joan of Austria. 3. The gay and dashing widow
bewitched, Isabella Orsini. 4. Pietro's neglected but
equally gay wife, Eleonora. And, 5. Bianca Capello.</p>

<p>Poor Camilla was very shortly eliminated, being
sentenced by the new Grand–duke to perform suttee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
by being buried alive in a monastery; where he with
inveterate hatred kept her imprisoned during his whole
life, notwithstanding the reiterated intercessions of
the Cardinal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISABELLA ORSINI.</div>

<p>The position of his own wife, Giovanna, was not
much better. She led a lonely life in her own apartments,
treated with all but insult by the courtiers, who
lavished on Bianca the homage which follows the
dispenser of court favours.</p>

<p>Remained the three younger ladies, the ornaments
of Francesco's court, the cynosure of Florentine eyes,
the promoters and centre of all festivities, and the
devisers of all sorts of diversions and frolic schemes.
The general licence of the manners of the time, the
high social position of the fair bevy, and the special
dissoluteness and neglect of their natural protectors,
permitted them to push their sport unchecked very
considerably beyond the boundary line, which separates
venial levity from conduct that leaves permanent and
ineffaceable stains behind it. Isabella had long since
"thrown her cap over the roofs," to use the classic
French phrase—aye, over the topmost cupola of the
<i>Duomo</i>. Paolo Giordano Orsini was pursuing his own
not very dissimilar course at Rome, and took but little
heed of the almost unknown wife, who was off his
hands under the care of her own family; and Isabella
had ingratiated herself with her brother Francesco in
the manner most acceptable to him, by taking kindly
to Bianca from the first;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> the more so as she was the
only one of his family who had ever done so. Pietro's
young wife, Eleonora, showed every disposition to
follow to the full extent the example he set her. And
Bianca, though her doings do not appear to have at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
any time taken such a shape as to give Francesco any
cause for jealousy, was ready to go all lengths with
the others of the trio as far as lavish extravagance,
festivities of which the details were more or less unfit
to meet the scrutiny of the public eye, and general
"emancipation" from "prejudice," were concerned.</p>

<p>So that the Grand Duke Francesco found himself at
the head of a somewhat skittish court; a Capua of the
<i>renaissance</i>, which was beginning to attract unfavourable
notice from the other courts of Italy. When the pot
chances to be a shade blacker than usual, the kettle,
we know, is ever loudest in abuse of it. Besides, the
disorders of the Tuscan court seem to have had a
certain Tom–and–Jerry flavour about them, which
greatly scandalised and disgusted many Highnesses,
Eminences, and Excellencies of different degrees of
Illustriousness and Serenity, who would not have
minded a few decently veiled assassinations or any
amount of respectably quiet poisonings. And Francesco,
who flattered himself, very mistakenly, that by
dint of a certain dose of Louis–Onze–like devoutness,
he had contrived to keep character enough for one,
was painfully conscious of the fact that he assuredly
had not any to spare for covering the deficiencies of
others.</p>

<p>Francesco, moreover, was not a man of a festive
disposition. On the contrary, he was almost always
under the shadow of a black and unwholesome melancholy.
Not that he abstained from excess in many
ways. Indeed, all the habits of his life were especially
marked by the absence of all moderation. But a
savage and ungenial nature showed itself in his pleasures
as in his more serious moments. His violence
of ill–temper, and sombre suspicious moodiness, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
often have taxed to the utmost all Bianca's powers of
dissimulation, and all her forbearance. The lot, which
she sacrificed fair fame, peace of mind, and ease of
conscience to attain, was one which few would have
endured without flinching, had it been awarded to them
to bear it. All the contemporary accounts represent
Bianca's powers of fascination and persuasion to have
been remarkable. And she had need of them all to
soothe the ill–governed mind, and calm the half–insane
violences of the Grand Duke's savage moods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE'S MOODINESS.</div>

<p>These had of late years been growing on him. He
had no child to be his heir; and this was a constant
source of brooding discontent and melancholy. His
wife, Giovanna, had given birth to several infants; but
they were all daughters. Bianca had never presented
him with a child. To Francesco it was an odious and
intolerable thought that either of his brothers should
be the successor to his throne. And it was as much a
matter of repining to him that Bianca was childless, as
that his wife should not have given him an heir. A
subsequent marriage legitimises a child born out of
wedlock, according to the Romish code. Failing other
means, pontifical dispensations were always at hand to
help orthodox and Church–loving princes over such
difficulties. And Francesco would have deemed a son
by Bianca almost as desirable as one by his legitimate
wife. But the years went on, and he continued without
either.</p>

<p>All this contributed, as may be easily imagined, to
make Bianca's task a hard one, and her life a continued
series of anxieties, contrivances, plottings, and
machinations.</p>

<p>But Francesco had another passion, which led him
to look with a discontented eye on the disorders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
excesses of his court,—his avarice. He, like his
father, Cosmo, was rich, far beyond what might have
been supposed, from his rank and position among the
sovereigns of Europe. No mode of extracting money
from his subjects was left untried by him. Venal
pardons, excessive taxation, and wholesale confiscations,
helped to fill his coffers. But he derived still
larger revenues from the trading speculations which
both he and Cosmo carried on in almost every part of
Europe. There was hardly one of the great commercial
centres of the time, where the Grand Duke of
Florence had not a share in some banking concern.
He was also interested as a partner in a great variety
of speculations of various kinds. And besides all this,
he traded largely with ships of his own in grain, wool,
pepper and other spices, silk and leather.</p>

<p>The vast wealth thus amassed he used in purchasing
by large loans the good–will and seeming consideration
of the courts of Paris and Madrid. In both he was
despised and disliked. But both were so accustomed
to look upon him as a squeezeable money–dealer, that
we find the French court absolutely making jealous
complaints<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> of the amount he had furnished to that
of Spain.</p>

<p>All these circumstances combined to make the mood
of Francesco dangerous to those about him in the years
which immediately followed his father's death. Don
Pietro's recklessly scandalous life, and much worse still
his constant demands for money, annoyed him. The
remonstrances and preachments of the Cardinal Ferdinando
from Rome irritated him. But Francesco was
perfect as a dissembler. No man or woman was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
confidant. Not even to Bianca did he show any sign
that his ill–humour was rising to a point above its usual
mark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARDINAL'S VEXATIONS.</div>

<p>So the reckless holiday–keeping court circle spun on
in their usual course around him. Isabella and Eleonora
were busy with their free–lance captains, and
court pages. Bianca was hoarding money to send to
her greedy family at Venice, or was holding secret
council with some philtre–dealer or black–art professor
of one sort or another. Pietro was wilder, more lawless,
and audacious in his debaucheries than ever. And
the highly respectable Ferdinand was anxiously, and
almost despairingly, watching them all from Rome,
while they were continually throwing down, by the disreputableness
of their lives, the edifice of the family
greatness, which he was ever laboriously and dexterously
scheming to build up.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that his respectable Eminence
the Cardinal had enough to provoke and embitter him
with his relatives. He and Bianca had from the first
been declared enemies. He deplored his brother's
weakness in becoming enamoured of this designing
Venetian woman. He was indignant at the publicity
Francesco had permitted his connection with her to
assume. He remonstrated again and again with him
on the impropriety of allowing her to have the influence
in matters of government which it was notorious she
exercised, and on the impolicy of exposing himself to
the contempt and ridicule of every court in Europe on
her account. But his exhortations had only had the
effect of producing a state of enmity between Francesco
and himself, which Bianca is accused of having used
all her art to perpetuate and envenom.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p>Such was the state of things in the Medicean
domestic circle in the summer of the year 1576; when
the working together of all these passions, and all these
ill–conditioned and depraved wills culminated in one
of those catastrophes which have rendered the name of
Medici infamous throughout all time, and made it a
beacon to warn off mankind from any approach
towards that condition of social system which rendered
the production of such hideous phenomena possible.</p>

<p>The Cardinal Ferdinand, though rarely seen in
Florence, kept himself accurately and minutely informed
of all that passed in his brother's court there.
No nunnery wall was scaled by Don Pietro, no masked
night excursion planned by Donna Isabella, no assignation
made by Donna Eleonora, no secret colloquy
held with some scoundrel black–art quack and poison–dealer
by Donna Bianca, no fresh outrage on his murmuring
subjects committed by the Duke, without
speedy and detailed information thereof reaching the
much provoked Cardinal in his Roman palace. And
whether it so happened, that tidings of some more
flagrant indecency than usual had reached his Eminence
just then, or whether it were merely that the
last drop had made the cup run over, it would seem
that Ferdinando—(who, to do him justice, never permitted<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
his resentment against his brother to stand in
the way of his efforts to support the family interest, and
to save Francesco from the consequences of his own
ill–conduct)—made, about the time mentioned, some
communication to the Duke, urging on him the absolute
necessity of putting some stop to the scandals
caused by the conduct of the ladies of his family.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">ISABELLA ORSINI.</div>

<p>Many similar exhortations had produced no visible
effect. But it would appear that the irritating message
this time fell on Francesco's moody mind at a dangerous
moment. His first step was to send off a summons
to Paolo Giordano Orsini at Rome, to come
forthwith, and with all secrecy, to Florence.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Now, when Orsini had left his wife in Florence, he
had placed one of his relatives, Troilo Orsini, near
her, as a sort of guardian and mentor. Troilo, however,
soon became one of Isabella's numerous lovers;
and limited the duties of his mentorship to insisting
that he should be her only one. But there was a
certain court page, one Lelio Torelli, of whom he was
especially jealous. And as his efforts to induce
Isabella to give up this youth were vain, he performed
his duty to his kinsman by running the page through
the body. Torelli unfortunately was the son of a man
of note, who had been one of Duke Cosmo's chief
ministers; and the murder, therefore, could not be
easily hushed up or overlooked. Criminal proceedings
were instituted against Troilo Orsini, and in the course
of them a number of facts were revealed criminatory<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
of Isabella.</p>

<p>All this Francesco poured into the ear of Paolo
Giordano Orsini on his arrival in Florence. No record
has reached us of the details of what passed between
the Duke and his brother–in–law at the secret colloquy
that took place between them on this occasion. But
the last words that Francesco uttered, as Orsini left
him, were overheard, and have curiously enough been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
preserved.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> "When you have satisfied yourself of the
odious truth, remember always that you are a Christian
and a gentleman!" said the Duke, who had learned
his ideas of either character in the school of Philip II.
of Spain. He moreover lent Orsini during his stay in
Florence the villa now called Poggio Imperiale, near
the Roman gate of the city. To Isabella her husband
assumed the appearance of perfect cordiality and
affection. He had brought her, he said, a present of a
couple of greyhounds, and begged her to accompany
him to the villa to try them. It is said that the unhappy
woman accepted the invitation with terrible
misgivings. She went, however; and the next morning
Florence heard that the Lady Isabella had died suddenly
in the night; and the court physicians, who were
called to look at the body, testified that apoplexy was
the cause of her death. The cause of the apoplexy
was not stated; but the general belief was, and has
been among Florentine historians ever since, that it
was brought on by a cord around her neck drawn
tightly by the hands of her husband.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The historians admit that there exists no direct
proof that Francesco and Ferdinando, both or either of
them, were accomplices in this murder. But they
appear to have very little doubt upon the subject; and,
indeed, the circumstantial evidence seems almost conclusive,
especially as regards Francesco. There is the
direct statement of the Settimanni<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> chronicle, that
Orsini was sent for from Rome that he might consent
to his wife's death. There is the general popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
belief at the time and ever since. And there is the
fact that both Ferdinando and Francesco continued on
perfectly friendly terms with Paolo Giordano after
Isabella's death, and interested themselves, as they
had not before done, in the settlement of his numerous
debts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISABELLA ORSINI.</div>

<p>The unfortunate Isabella Orsini has been very
leniently judged by her countrymen. She was beautiful;
carefully and highly educated, so far as the
phrase includes exclusively intellectual culture; was a
distinguished musician; spoke and wrote correctly
several languages, including that of ancient Rome;
was a poetess in a small way; and some philological
treatise by her, still to be found in print in Italian
libraries, indicates that she was not <i>wholly</i> given up to
pursuits little compatible with intellectual exercise.
Impudicity had been from her tender years instilled
into her, both by precept and example, by an authority
which nature's earliest dictates teach a child to consider
as sacred above all others. With such a father and
sovereign as Cosmo, and living in such a state of
society as that which surrounded her, where the abundant
practice of "religious duties" intertwined with,
and forming a large part of every–day life, was joined
to a degree of ignorance and neglect of "moral duties"
unequalled, perhaps, in any other age and country, could
Isabella Orsini have been other than lost as she was?</p>

<p>But the reforming hand which was to restore the
court and family of the Medici to respectability, was
not satisfied with one victim. It was on the 16th of
July that Isabella Orsini was murdered; some days
having been lost, as may be supposed, between the
remonstrance of the Cardinal and the arrival of Paolo
Giordano in Florence. The other victim, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
whose destined executioner was at hand, perished
exactly one week earlier. When Francesco sent for
his brother–in–law from Rome, he also summoned his
brother Pietro to an interview.</p>

<p>Here again we have no means of knowing what
passed between the brothers, other than such as can
be gathered from the facts which followed thereupon,
and from the well–known and well–marked characters
of the actors. Drawing from these sources of knowledge,
Guerrazzi, in his Racconto, entitled "Isabella
Orsini," has fashioned forth the dialogue which may be
supposed to have passed between them, with a verisimilitude
as to circumstances and words, and an
absolute truth as to character, so vividly illustrative of
the men and the time, that an extract from it will
convey more historical truth than many a page from a
matter–of–fact chronicle.</p>

<p>Francesco begins by reproaching Don Pietro with
his extravagances. "Don Francesco," answers the
scapegrace, "Remember that I have come hither on
the faith of your safe–conduct. Do not kill me with a
sermon."</p>

<p>"Do I deserve this at your hands?" returned the
elder, after some further disputing. "Have I not
given, and do I not continue to give, proof of my love
for my own blood?"</p>

<p>"As for your own, I don't know; but you certainly
love blood...."</p>

<p>"I have to tell you then," said Francesco, "that
you are the most abject, the most shameless, and most
infamous knight that lives this day in Christendom."</p>

<p>"Strong language!" sneered Pietro. "Let us
come to facts."</p>

<p>"Your wife is an adulteress."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FRANCESCO AND PIETRO.</div>

<p>"I am perfectly well aware of the circumstance."</p>

<p>"What! you know it! and have not avenged your
shame!"</p>

<p>"We Medici have never been lucky in our wives."</p>

<p>Francesco, in fury, asks what he means to insinuate
against either the Grand Duchess or Bianca. And
here the writer commits an error in chronology. For
he writes as if this conversation occurred after the
death of the Grand Duchess, which was not the fact.
The circumstances of this narrative took place in
1576, and the Grand Duchess lived till 1578. As to
Bianca, in reply to the Grand Duke's assertion that
she must be considered as washed from all that had
preceded his connection with her, Pietro retorts:</p>

<p>"Such washing will not remove all stains. Sometimes
a piece of the stuff may sooner be destroyed than
the spot on it. And on your hand there must be a
certain red mark that all Arno cannot wash away. It
is the stain of Bonaventuri's blood."</p>

<p>"Who says that I slew Bonaventuri? If my father
asserted it, I would tell him that he lied. I neither
did nor ordered anything. I can swear it."</p>

<p>"Between ordering, insinuating, foreseeing, suspecting,
conniving, not seeing, and so forth, no doubt
if the cause had to be tried before this world's judges,
the pettifoggers of the courts could find you so many
limitations and distinctions that you would be acquitted
nem. con. But before God one does not appear by
means of one's attorney...."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful! How much have my enemies given
you to make me die of anger? Is this a way to speak
to your liege lord, who if he would, could break you
like a reed. And that, too, when I am intent on preserving
your reputation!... I have discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the infamous destroyer of your honour, and have put
him to death."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he deserved it, but he was a very
worthy cavalier."</p>

<p>"Who told you that he was a cavalier?"</p>

<p>"What! Bernardino Antinori, whom you had
strangled in prison! Who told me? Well, that is
good! Who told me, indeed? Francesco, let me say
a few words to you plainly and openly after my own
manner. We can do what we think fit; but on one
condition, which is this; that we let others talk as
they think fit. The people we employ in matters of
this sort are vile and infamous from their birth upwards;
and if they could find some one to throw them
a bigger sop for murdering us, than we give them for
murdering others, they would do so. Do you expect
fidelity or secrecy from such? In the taverns and in
their low orgies, they vomit forth their secrets of blood,
often true, oftener exaggerated twofold, till down there
among the people, who know us but little, we find an
accumulated hoard of hatred that makes one shudder
to look at it."</p>

<p>"Have you done?"</p>

<p>"One minute, and I have done. Add to all this
the curse of the pen.... Who knows how many
traders are at this hour writing in their ledgers between
the records of a purchase of wool, and a sale of silk:
<i>Item</i>. I record that on such a day in such a year
from the Incarnation, Francesco de' Medici caused the
Cavaliere Bernardino Antinori to be strangled for
adultery with the lady Eleonora di Toledo, wife of
Don Pietro dei Medici.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> And then, besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
merchants, there are the moralisers, and the history–writers,
and all the rest of the literary generation, to
whom I make a point of being civil, since we cannot
drive them out of the world.... But I see
that I am putting you to sleep. You were saying—what
was it? Oh! that you had had the Cavaliere
Antinori strangled."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRANCESCO AND PIETRO.</div>

<p>Francesco, continues Signor Guerrazzi, who was
naturally and habitually sparing of speech, and wont
to come directly to his point, felt as if his head was
going round with all this flux of words. He needed
to recover himself a little; and it was sometime before
he resumed his discourse thus.</p>

<p>"Well then, if you know the treason of your wife,
why is she still alive?"</p>

<p>"Because, if I come to my <i>confiteor</i>, I fancy that I
have more sins on my shoulders than she has; and,
further, because I do not see clearly who would save
me from the vengeance of her uncle the Duke of Alva,
and her brother Toledo, who, between ourselves, are
not altogether saints to have to deal with."</p>

<p>"And can we not protect you against a viceroy and
a duke...."</p>

<p>"In short, you want me to make you a present of
the life of Eleonora; and I am willing to do so. A
wife is not worth falling out about. But you on your
part must be a good brother ... and let me
have some forty thousand ducats, that I am sadly in
want of."</p>

<p>"All of you eaten up with debt! All out at elbows!
You, the Cardinal, and Orsini would swallow all Peru.
Where am I to get all this money?"</p>

<p>"A squeeze well administered to the udders of the
Republic would put all to rights. But you have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
need even to do that. Rumour says, that what with
gold in coin and in ingots, and in precious stones, you
have hoarded better than ten millions of money....
Besides, the public revenue, after all expenses are
paid, gives you more than three hundred thousand
ducats."</p>

<p>"And who dares to call me to account as to the
amount?"</p>

<p>"You had better hang the multiplication table.
Then, again, you make a mine of money by your
commerce in leather, precious stones, grain, and
pepper."</p>

<p>"Losses upon all of them! I have made up my
mind to give up commerce. Perhaps,—I have not
quite made up my mind,—perhaps I may continue
to trade in pepper. But no more leather!—no more
grain! He who trades in grain dies on straw."</p>

<p>"Do as you think best. But will you give me the
forty thousand ducats?"</p>

<p>"Good heaven! where can you get rid of so much
money?"</p>

<p>"Give it to me, and be sure that in so doing you lay
it out well. I employ it in making you friends. I
spend it among the people in festivities, in banquets,
in pleasure. The rising generation is thus habituated
to expense and luxury. I enervate it to your hand; I
degrade it; I emasculate its intellect; I destroy its
dignity of mind and its strength of body. I prepare
it to receive the seed; so that you may sow it with
what best suits your purpose."</p>

<p>"In truth, your humour is of a strange turn! You
shall have the forty thousand ducats. But you will
sign me an obligation to repay them little by little from
your Pisan property."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CAFAGGIUOLO.</div>

<p>"As for obligations, I will sign you as many as you
please."</p>

<p>"Moreover——"</p>

<p>"Oh dear me! now come the restrictions!"</p>

<p>"No! only you will undertake the removal of your
infamous wife when and where I shall command."</p>

<p>"This article is also agreed to. When am I to have
the ducats?"</p>

<p>"To–morrow!"</p>

<p>And in accordance with the characteristic scene thus
painted for us by Signor Guerrazzi, we find on returning
from verisimilitude to recorded fact, that on the
ninth of July in the year 1576, just a week previous to
the murder of Isabella Orsini, the wretched Eleonora,—she
too another victim of Cosmo's atrocious profligacy—was
put to death by Don Pietro's own hand at
the Villa of Cafaggiuolo. That ill–omened place is a
castle among the Apennines, some fifteen or twenty
miles from Florence, which the traveller thence to
Bologna will hardly fail to notice. Solitary and desolate
as it stands now among the mountains by the side
of the high–road, it was yet more so, when no such
road existed. The dark naked stone tower standing
there on the hill–side turf, without tree or cultivation
near it of any kind, strikes the imagination as the
very spot adapted for such a crime.</p>

<p>Of course, as usual, there were medical declarations
of the cause of her death, and the courts were duly
informed that God had pleased to take to himself our
dearly beloved sister–in–law, &amp;c. But it is remarkable
that to his agent at the court of Philip II., Francesco
wrote a private letter, which is still extant,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> ordering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>him to communicate the whole truth of the murder
to that monarch. And Philip, while expressing regret
for the cause of the crime, manifested no disapproval
of it, and promised all secrecy concerning it.</p>

<p>It is recorded, that Don Pietro immediately after
the perpetration of the deed, with hands yet bloody
from the task, took the precaution of imploring pardon
for it, from a figure of the Virgin Mary in an adjoining
chapel, promising at the same time, that as an expiation
he would thenceforth remain single;—a vow which he
did not keep.</p>

<p>Thus were decency and respectability restored, it
was hoped, to the court life at Florence. Bianca's
sins, as has been intimated, were of a different kind,
from those of the two murdered princesses. But
Francesco's gloomy temper and fits of violence, joined
to such an example of his mode of action when irritated,
could not have been re–assuring to the survivor
of the trio court beauties.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">Bianca balances her accounts.—Dangers in her path.—A bold step—and
its consequences.—Facilis descensus.—A proud father.—Bianca's
witchcraft.—The Cardinal is checkmated, for this game.</p>

<p class="pn p2">But whatever other effect the untimely deaths of
these two unfortunate women may have produced, they
had not that of removing the gloom from the brow of
Francesco. Surely, indeed, if he is to be considered
human, and in any degree sane, it may be thought,
that such events must have contributed no little to
increase the irritability of his temper, and the sudden
melancholy, ever and anon bursting out into savageness.
It is likely enough that Francesco's education at the
Court of Spain, the obsequious casuistry of his own
theologians, and the total absence from cradle to grave
of any one wholesome moral influence, of any one ray
of light to dissipate, however fitfully, the thick darkness
of an ignorance of right and wrong far deeper,
more dangerous, and more perverse than that of a
savage;—it is possible enough, that all this may have
enabled him to say to his own heart, when kneeling at
the feet of his most favourite idol, that his act had not
made him guilty within the limitations of God's statute
law, and the intricate modifications of it made by
subsequent legislation, in such and such acts of such
and such a year of this or the other Pope's reign.</p>

<p>Still, assure himself of this as he might, and fortify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the assurance by whatsoever most satisfactory "case,"
drawn up by the shrewdest sacerdotal pettifogger who
ever discovered a flaw in heaven's eternal ordinances,
it may be fancied that he did not sleep better of
nights after that July, 1576, and that Bianca's position
and task were not improved by what had happened.</p>

<p>Some thirty years or so ago, a Florentine publisher,
happening to have become possessed of the house
which once belonged to Bianca, in the Via Maggio, conceived
the idea of pretending to have found concealed
in a wall therein a MS. containing her autobiography.
A prefatory notice stated, that unfortunately the
chemical means used for restoring the faded characters
to legibility had had the effect of entirely destroying
them, so that the finder of these precious papers could
not have the satisfaction he had hoped of showing
them to persons interested in such matters! The
forgery was an impudent and ridiculously ill–executed
one. A very superficial knowledge of the language
sufficed to convince any reader of the first two pages
of the silly catch–penny trash, that the phraseology
was of the nineteenth and not the sixteenth century,
even had the tone of the narrative been at all assorted
to the character of the supposed writer.</p>

<p>But what a treat would such a find be, were it
genuine! What a psychological treasure would be a
peep into the real feelings of such a mind and heart!
Did Bianca consider her career to be a triumphant one,
successfully achieving the "excelsior" of her ideal by
painful but victorious struggle with opposing fortune?
Or did she look on herself as the victim of a chain of
unfortunate circumstances, entangled in the meshes of
a destiny, which drew her fatally on, and irresistibly
wrapped its darkening clouds around her. Few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
recorded careers illustrate so exactly, regularly, and
undeviatingly the lessons of the moralist as that of
Bianca. No invented story of progress from bad to
worse can better exemplify the law that compels evil
to generate ever new evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"MUST HE BECOME WORSE!"</div>

<p>Thus far, supposing her not to have been guilty of
her husband's murder, her ill–doings have not been
such as to put her beyond the pale of human
sympathies. She fled from a home made unhappy
by a negligent father and an unkind step–mother.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
It was ill–done. Deceived by her husband as to his
position in the world, finding herself a prisoner in a
miserable cottage, where she was obliged to do the
work of a servant (because the poverty of her husband's
family was such, that when she was brought home to
be fed and lodged, the drudge hitherto kept by them
could be no longer fed or lodged),<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> she listened to the
seduction of a prince, and left a husband, who was
perfectly contented with the arrangement. This was
worse; yet far from unpardonable.</p>

<p>But now a career of darker crime had to be entered
on. Bianca was now the inmate of a court. Virtues
and vices there are on a larger scale. "Major rerum
nascitur ordo." The interests and passions of despotic
princes are dangerous matters to meddle with, mostly
leaving stains and scars on the hands and hearts of
those concerned in ministering to them. Enough of
both, one would think, must have fallen to Bianca's lot.</p>

<p>Let us see, then, if we can succeed in looking into
her mind, as it must at this period have contemplated
her position, taking stock of the gains and losses thus
far realised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"To exercise the most powerful influence in a
splendid court; to receive daily homage, and something
more solid than homage, from all who have favours to
ask, justice to seek, or injustice to pay for; to dispense
promotions, reward friends and crush enemies; all this
is worth something. To be the courted patroness of
the relatives who so loudly complained of my having
disgraced them, to dispense my bounty to the father
and brother who denounced me, and to be the means
of sustaining and advancing the grandeur of the family
whose daughter I am; all this is worth still more.
To become, what, if fate do not play me false, I will
become, and make the Ten themselves bow before the
poor outlawed exile! Ay, that indeed would be more
again. It is something, too, by the blaze of my beauty
and the glitter of my magnificence, to thrust back that
pale, proud Austrian woman into cold obscurity. She,
indeed, to think of being a wife to Francesco! She
to dream of taking in charge such a nature as his!
She to attempt the task of comprehending, sympathising
with, soothing, managing, ay, and mastering
those surging passions, that wilful mind, and fitful
heart! She! It is a part cast, methinks, for an
actress of other powers than hers! But what if it
should prove too difficult for my own? She, indeed,
is at least secure in the frozen dignity of her place.
She is the Grand Duchess, and needs to practise no
such ruling of the storms to hold her safe position.
But for me! To rule them, or to perish in them, is
the only alternative. If I cease to rule but for a day,
I fall, and am crushed into the dust! That is the
condition on which I hold my place in Florence! And
the Saints know how many waking nights and anxious
days the holding of it thus far has cost me! And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
task seems growing from day to day more arduous.
The Duke's deepening melancholy and discontent at
his childlessness is dangerous—very dangerous. May
he not seek elsewhere for that which I have failed to
give him! Francesco loves me;—I think he loves
me;—that is, he has need of me. But should some
more painfully felt need require that I should be
sacrificed, trampled into dust, burned at the stake,
torn limb from limb; my Francesco's love, methinks,
would hardly save me. Had I but a child, could I but
be the mother of a son to stand between him and the
Cardinal, I should, I think, be safe!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BOLD STEP.</div>

<p>Somewhat to this tune, we may suppose, Bianca's
ruminations must have often run during the early
months of that fatal summer of 1576; till at length
the urgency of the case, arising from the Duke's
increasing gloom and discontent, determined her to
adopt the dangerous expedient of counterfeiting the
maternity which nature denied her.</p>

<p>From the earliest years of her connection with
Francesco, it had been her earnest wish to present
him with a son. And when, as time ran on, it began
to appear unlikely that she should do so, she left none
of the means untried, to which the gross ignorance
and superstition of the time attributed the power of
removing sterility. With this view, she had constantly
about her a number of the vilest vagabonds, impostors,
philtre–dealers, necromancers, poison–concoctors, spellmongers,
and quack–doctors in Europe. In all probability
she practised with love–philtres, to secure her
ascendancy over the Duke. It may have been, also,
that she had occasion to dabble in the secrets of the
professors of the art of poisoning. But the grand
object of her medico–witchcraft was to become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
mother. And it is exceedingly likely, that some of the
means used for this purpose may have actively contributed
to defeat the end in view, and have done
much to injure her health permanently, as we find
hinted in the writings of the historians.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The people, whom these schemes and pursuits had
brought her into connection with, were well calculated
to serve as agents in the fraud now contemplated. The
first necessary step was to find a mother, who could
be induced to agree to part with her infant, when it
should be born. But as the great object of Bianca's
ambition was to present the Duke with a son, it was
necessary to provide, as far as possible, against
uncertainty on this point. For this purpose three
women were found, who expected their confinement,
as nearly as could be calculated, at the same time;
and who all consented for money to give up their child,
in case it should prove to be a male. But it was
further very necessary to the safety of all concerned
in the business, that these women should be ignorant
that a similar bargain had been made with others.
Care had therefore to be taken that they should be
located in different quarters of the city, and should
have no means of corresponding with any one.</p>

<p>All these arrangements must evidently have required
the co–operation of no inconsiderable number of agents.
But it is probable that one or two of these only were
allowed to know on whose behalf they were acting.</p>

<p>At length all these preparations were made, and the
29th of August, 1576, was fixed on among the confederates
for the consummation of the plan. Bianca
played her part accordingly to perfection. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
her fictitious labour would have to endure, till the
genuine labour of whichever of the three unfortunate
mothers should first produce a son, should have come
to an end. One only of the three had a male child;
and this was immediately conveyed, in a mandoline,
say the chronicles of the time, to Bianca's residence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TRAGI–COMEDY.</div>

<p>But it was yet further necessary, before the innocent
object of all this roguery could be allowed to appear
upon the scene, that Bianca should find the means of
clearing her chamber of inconvenient witnesses. And
this was not altogether easy. For the Grand Duke,
whose rejoicing at the coming event had been excessive,
insisted on being himself present at the birth; and it
was impossible to get him out of the chamber. The
only possibility of success lay in the chance of tiring
him out. And Bianca did her best to render the
witnessing of her pangs as disagreeable as possible.
But Francesco's sensibilities were not to be worked on
in this manner. Let Bianca play her part to the life,
as she would, Francesco patiently awaited the result.
The long hours of the night wore on. Morning was
at hand. Bianca's lamentable groaning, kept up with
admirable constancy in spite of no little fatigue from
her night's performance, became tedious, if not heartrending
to the princely watcher. He was very sleepy;
the women, with grave shakings of the head, feared
that the patient would have to suffer some hours yet;
and at last his Highness, as morning was breaking,
gave in, and went off to his bed; leaving however some
trusted minister in his stead to await the happy
moment, and give him the earliest intelligence thereof.</p>

<p>The game was now an easy one. Some message to
the Duke, or other such commission was readily found
to send away the deputy–watcher; and then in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
minutes all was in order for the reception of Francesco,
who hurried from his bed to delight himself with the
sight of the son he had so long and so earnestly wished
for. All passed with the most perfect success. No
shadow of a suspicion seems to have arisen in the
Grand Ducal mind. He immediately recognised the
child formally as his own; ordered that he should be
considered a member of the House of Medici; and
received the congratulations of the court and city, as
if an heir to the throne had been legitimately born.
The child was christened Antonio, because, according
to the pious declaration of Bianca, it was to the intercession
of St. Anthony that the favour of so great a
blessing was due.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>But the ridiculous side of this ignoble farce lies in
too close proximity to its tragic developments, to
suffer that a smile should for more than a passing
moment replace the horror and reprobation which are
the standing moods of mind for the study of Medicean
annals. Bianca's triumph was complete for the
moment. But on how many chances might the continuance
of it hang? How many of the most worthless
beings had it in their power to hurl her, with a word,
from the height of her success! Was she then never
again to be free from perpetual terrors? Never to lose
for an hour the consciousness, that a random word, if
not an intentional and purchased betrayal, the repentance
of a confederate, or a death–bed confession might
at any time suffice to throw down the whole fabric
built up with so much care, pain, and cost of guilt;
nay, might bring on her the same swift and sudden
vengeance which had overtaken the unhappy Isabella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and Eleonora! Was there <i>no</i> mode of escaping from
so hideous a thraldom?</p>

<div class="sidenote">ESCAPE.</div>

<p>Then again it was to be remembered that eyes and
brains of a quality very difficult to be eluded or deceived
would leave no means untried to ascertain the truth
respecting this timely maternity after so many years of
sterility. The Cardinal was hardly likely to attribute
much efficacy to the intercession of St. Anthony. And
who in Florence could at any time feel sure that they
were not at that very moment under his special
surveillance? Then again Don Pietro, equally injured
and enraged with his brother Ferdinando at this
suddenly produced Medici! his haunts and habits
were such as to make it anything but unlikely that he
might stumble on the traces of the deception that had
been practised.</p>

<p>The Duchess, most nearly and cruelly injured of all!
Pshaw! if she were all, there could be small cause for
alarm.</p>

<p>Was there <i>no</i> way of escaping once and for ever
from these haunting torments; escaping once for all
from fears and from plots and conspiracies, and all
underhand dealings and living honestly and uprightly
thenceforward? The safety, the happiness of such a
freedom, the possibility of carrying out such virtuous
aspirations must be found.</p>

<p>Is there <i>no</i> way?</p>

<p class="b1">There is but one way, Bianca thinks, as she spends
the hours of the pretended convalescence in no pleasing
meditations on her position;—but <i>one</i> way.</p>

<p class="ppq20">"She must—she must;—she will—she will,<br />
Spill much more blood; and become worse<br />
To make her title good!"</p>

<p class="p1">The thought once admitted, delay in the execution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of it only risked the possibility of doing the deed in
vain. The greatest danger was to be apprehended of
course from the three mothers; inasmuch, as the
mere fact of the bargain made with them, joined to the
exact date of their confinement, would have been
sufficient to raise a presumption which it would have
been easy to improve into certain proof of the real
truth.</p>

<p>Two of these women therefore were put to death by
disguised assassins; the third, having obtained some
warning of her danger, escaped out of Tuscany.</p>

<p>But the chief manager of the whole plot had been a
Bolognese woman, in whom Bianca placed implicit
confidence. Still she could not feel safe as long as it
was in any human being's power to betray her. This
woman was therefore sent back to Bologna; or rather,
the doomed creature was made to believe that such
was her destination. But as she and her escort were
crossing the Apennine, winding in single file along the
deep–cut bridle paths that threaded the chesnut[typo for chestnut?] woods,
a shot from behind a tree brought her to the ground.
The assassins thought that their work was done more
thoroughly than was the case. The wound indeed
was mortal; but the unfortunate woman lived long
enough to reach Bologna, and there, being juridically
examined, she confessed at length the whole of the
plot by which Bianca had foisted a supposititious child
on the Grand Duke, together with all details of the
execution of the fraud.</p>

<p>This confession, duly attested by the authorities at
Bologna, was forwarded to the Cardinal Ferdinando at
Rome, and his feelings on receiving it may easily be
imagined. He must have thought that he had at last
in his hand the means of crushing the hated Venetian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
woman, whose arts and spells had so enthralled his
brother as to disgrace him throughout Europe, and by
whose infamous practices it seemed but too probable
that some base–born brat might be placed on the throne
of Tuscany to his nefarious exclusion. What then
was his indignation and disgust, when on hastening to
lay before his brother the irrecusable proof, as he
supposed, of his mistress's foul treason and falsehood,
he found him obstinately determined neither to hear,
see, nor give credence to anything on the subject!
The power and credit of Bianca were greater than ever.
A magnificent appanage was settled upon the child
Antonio, whom the Duke persisted, in spite of all
evidence upon the subject, in considering and treating
as his son. He was called Don Antonio dei Medici;
and Francesco appeared to lavish on the infant all a
father's affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARDINAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT.</div>

<p>It must be admitted that there was wherewithal to
embitter a milder–minded man than the Cardinal. All
the calculating policy which had enabled his cautious
nature to dissemble his disgusts for so many years, so
far as to avoid an open rupture with his brother, could
not prevent him now from speaking in a manner that
for a time produced a total estrangement between him
and the Grand Duke. Such deplorable blindness and
imbecility as that manifested by Francesco, could only
have been produced, it was said, by the use of infernal
arts, and drugs of maleficent power. The belief in
the efficacy of such agencies was general. It is therefore
extremely probable, that the Cardinal himself may
have supposed Francesco to have been bewitched in
the literal sense of the word. That Bianca was
credited with extensive powers of the kind by the
popular opinion of Florence is certain. And it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
equally clear, that she herself, whatever may have been
her private opinion of her own proficiency in the art,
believed in its existence and potency, was continually
dabbling in the secrets of its professors, and would fain
have been a witch, if she could have found out how to
become one.</p>

<p>But the real witchery that Bianca had on this occasion
practised on her lover was not suspected by the
Cardinal; though, as it would seem from subsequent
events, he must have become aware of it later. It
was the common witchery of a strong and unscrupulous
mind over a weak one, whose only force was the
strength of the bad passions that stirred it. But the
spell used to evoke the demon that should give her
the victory in this perilous crisis of her fortunes was
one of extraordinary daring. And it was strikingly
characteristic of the woman, and curiously indicated
how thoroughly she had studied the nature of the man
she had to practise on, and how securely she reckoned
on the aid of the evil spirit she had summoned from
the dark depths of his own heart, in the form of his
jealous hatred of his brothers, and of the thought that
either of them should be his successor.</p>

<p>The bungling work of the bravo sent to make all
safe by dispatching the woman on the Apennines on
her way to Bologna, which had allowed her to reach
that city alive, left small doubt on Bianca's mind, that
the whole story of Antonio's birth would soon become
known to those from whom it was most necessary that
it should be kept secret.</p>

<p>The danger was a tremendous one. No philtres nor
drug practice would serve the turn now. But a bold
stroke of a more truly black art might do so. Now to
raise a devil potent enough to make wrong triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
over all right and truth! Bianca knew that such a
devil was within call, and went bravely about the
work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER SPELL.</div>

<p>Reminding Francesco skilfully of all that he had
suffered from being childless, subtly painting the
triumph and rejoicing of his brothers at this his bitter
misfortune, and picturing to him as subtly the downfall
of their hopes in consequence of the birth of Antonio,
when she had made the idea of relinquishing this
vantage ground sufficiently intolerable to his feelings,
she audaciously<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> narrated to him the whole truth of her
fictitious confinement, and Antonio's real birth. To
have had recourse to such an expedient was too evidently
the sole means of remedying the evil. To have deceived
him in the matter was to save his dignity, his conscience,
to take upon herself all the odium, the risk,
the burthen, the sin,—if sin there were in securing the
peace of mind and happiness of her sovereign and lord.
What but devotion to him, his wishes and his interests,
could have stimulated her to adopt, at her own peril,
the only possible means of abating the insolent triumph
of the disloyal brothers, who were rejoicing in his
misfortunes!</p>

<p>The incantation worked well. The devil was evoked.
Francesco could not endure the idea of returning to the
state of jealous misery in which he had lived before
Antonio's birth; above all could not endure the
thought of admitting to his prudent preaching brother
that he had been ignominiously and ridiculously cheated;
that his loud triumph had been premature; that the
Cardinal's warnings and denunciations of Bianca had
all been wise and just; and that now he—the Cardinal—must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
again step back into the position of the childless
brother's heir. No! all this was not to be thought of.
Bianca was—not pardoned—but blessed, as his best
friend and helpmate. And the Grand Duke was
thenceforward an accomplice in the fraud of substituting
a false heir.</p>

<p>Ferdinando, with his triumphant proofs in his hand,
was met, as has been told, with well–assumed impenetrable
incredulity. He found the Grand Duke busy
arranging the purchase of a principality in the kingdom
of Naples for two hundred thousand ducats, to be
settled on his darling child. And the dexterous, diplomatic,
able Cardinal, had to return to Rome baffled
and checkmated by a woman.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">The Duchess Giovanna and her sorrows.—An heir is born.—Bianca in
the shade.—The "Orti Oricellari."—Bianca entertains the Court
there.—A summer night's amusement in 1577.—The death of
Giovanna.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The conduct of the Grand Duke in neglecting his
wife, a daughter of the proud house of Austria, while
he abandoned himself to the seductions of a comparatively
low–born adventuress, had not failed to expose
him to urgent and very disagreeable remonstrances
from the family of the Duchess. At the death of her
brother Maximilian, negotiations were pending between
the Imperial Court and that of Tuscany on two subjects.
The first had reference to the full execution of
the Imperial diplomas and decrees, which had conferred
on the Grand Duke precedence over the other
princes of Italy. This had never been admitted by
them, especially by the house of Este. And Francesco
ceased not to clamour for the due recognition of his
rank. The other matter concerned the position of the
Grand Duchess Giovanna. Rodolph, Maximilian's
successor in the Empire, was anxious to remain on
good terms with Francesco. And one of his first cares
was to send an ambassador to Florence for the purpose
of arranging these matters amicably.</p>

<p>The grounds of complaint against the Grand Duke
on the part of Giovanna were sufficiently well founded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
But she seems to have brought forward one accusation,
from which her husband was able to defend himself
satisfactorily. She complained that the pecuniary
means allowed her were most insufficient; and that the
mortifications to which she was thus exposed, were
embittered by the lavish expenditure permitted to the
vile woman for whose sake her husband neglected her.
Now the truth was, that Giovanna was herself inordinately
extravagant. It was easy for her to show that
she had been driven to pledge her jewels and other
valuables by need of money. But the Imperial lady
did not seem to be aware that any limits ought to be
placed to her power of disbursing. Living, as she did,
wholly in a little court of her own Germans, her principal
pleasure seems to have consisted in enriching
them. And Francesco was able to show the Imperial
ambassadors that if Giovanna was in debt, it was
because she had spent more than the abundant income
allowed her. As usual in all disputes, the Grand
Duchess, by being wrong in this one point, made it the
more difficult for her friends to insist upon right being
done her in regard to those other matters, concerning
which her complaints were clearly just.</p>

<p>However, a certain amount of reconciliation was
brought about between her and Francesco; and what
contributed far more than the exhortations of the
Imperial Court, to make it for the moment genuine,
was the birth of a son in 1577. This event was to the
Grand Duke a subject of infinite rejoicing, and to
Bianca a proportionably great humiliation. She found
herself obliged to withdraw into perfect retirement,
and even to leave Florence for awhile. The immense
difference in her position, which was felt by herself
and all Florence to result from the birth of this legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
heir to the Duchy, is a measure of the importance
of the fraudulent introduction of Don Antonio, and of
the probability felt by all parties that means would
have been found to secure for him the succession to
the throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNDER A CLOUD.</div>

<p>Philip II. of Spain graciously acceded to the
Grand Duke's request that he would be godfather to
Giovanna's child; and it was accordingly named after
him.</p>

<p>During the first flush of the Grand Duke's triumph
and rejoicing at the birth of his son, Bianca remained
prudently in perfect retirement; and Giovanna flattered
herself that she should at last hold the place in
her husband's affections and in his court which were
her due. But the hold that Bianca had established on
Francesco's mind was too strong for him to be able to
free himself from it. The need of her had become
habitual to him, as is ever the case in associations
between a weak character and a strong one. The
illusions of poor Giovanna lasted but a very short
time. Even the interest attaching to her boy, important
as he was to the fortunes of the house of
Medici, could not avail to prevent Bianca's re–appearance
on the scene.</p>

<p>She returned to Florence, and soon found means of
showing, by the accumulated marks of the Grand
Duke's munificence towards her and her son, that the
Florentines were mistaken if they had imagined that
her reign was over.</p>

<p>One of the most notable, and it may be said, one of
the most scandalous, manifestations of this renewed
favour, was the gift of a palace and gardens in Florence,
which had already acquired an historical celebrity of a
widely different kind from that which was now to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
added to it as the scene of many of Bianca's more or
less disreputable orgies.</p>

<p>The property in question has since that time passed
through several hands, and the traveller who has
visited Florence will be most likely to remember it by
the name of its last proprietor, as the Palazzo Strozzi.
He will probably not have forgotten the large gardens
which stretch behind it, and which through all changes
have kept their original name, being still known as the
"Orti Oricellari." These gardens, with the dwelling
attached to them, were in the latter years of the
fifteenth century the property of Giorgio Rucellai, the
celebrated philosopher and historian. The house was
then a "casino," belonging to the gardens, instead of
being, as it now is, a palace, to which they are an
appendage. And the writers of the time, who have
frequently spoken of them, call them a "selva;" so that
we must picture the place to our imaginations as very
different from the trim garden which we now see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORTI ORICELLARI.</div>

<p>It was to this spot that Lorenzo the Magnificent's
Platonic Academy moved its sittings at his death in
1492. It was there that the brothers Palla and
Giovanni Rucellai, sons of Giorgio, received Leo X.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
when he came to Florence in 1515, and performed
before him Giovanni's tragedy of "Rosmunda," composed
in imitation of the Hecuba of Euripides,—one of
the first, if not perhaps the first, tragic representation
in Italy. It was there, too, that as times grew worse
in Florence, and the minds of good citizens had to
occupy themselves with matters more grave than
Platonic philosophy and tragedies in imitation of
Euripides, Macchiavelli read those discourses on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
first Decade of Livy, which were so well calculated to
rouse a spirit of patriotism, with which the author
himself seems to have sympathised so imperfectly.
It was there, also, that these readings bore their fruit
in that unsuccessful conspiracy against the Cardinal
Giulio, afterwards Clement VII., for which Jacopo
da Diaceto lost his head; and in consequence of
which the Academy was extinguished, and its members
dispersed. In these gardens, also, Macchiavelli laid the
scene of his dialogue on the Art of War. He describes
the thickness and vast height of the trees,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> several of
which were of kinds unknown to Fabrizio Colonna,
who is one of the interlocutors in the dialogue. He
commemorates the extraordinary freshness of the
herbage, the retired tranquillity and sylvan beauty of
the spot, enclosed as it was within the buildings of a
walled city; and speaks of this style of culture, contrasted
with that which we call Italian gardening, as
the ancient manner of cultivation.</p>

<p>And now this pleasant place, which was on so many
accounts classical ground to the Florentines, was made
the harbour of the very different sort of "Academy"
which Bianca assembled around her, and the principal
scene of their fooleries—to use a charitable term.</p>

<p>The details of one such night's amusement have
been preserved by the contemporary novelist, Celio
Malespini,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> who is well known to have drawn all his
materials from real history, and whose book may be
accepted as a perfectly accurate and trustworthy picture
of the manners of the time. Bianca's brother, Vittorio
Cappello, was expected to arrive in Florence with other
Venetian gentlemen, and the diversion in question was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
prepared for their especial delectation. The Grand
Duke, however, appears to have taken his full share in
the performances.</p>

<p>There was at that time, we are told, a necromancer
at Florence, who was one of the most powerful performers
in his profession. The garden had been
placed by Bianca at his disposition, and the sovereign
and court were invited by her to disport themselves as
follows.</p>

<p>"When the hour was come, the Grand Duke and his
companions repaired to the garden and walked in the
shade, waiting till the necromancer should have completed
his preparations. At last he came forth clad in
a most extraordinary manner, but quite in keeping
with his character. On his head was a mitre covered
with pentagons and all sorts of extravagant figures, so
that he appeared a veritable new Zoroaster. With
slow and stately steps he advanced to a spot prepared
for the purpose, and there drew a circle on the sward
with a knife. This circle corresponded in size with a
cavity which had previously been prepared beneath
the surface of the soil; and around he drew with the
knife a quantity of mystic signs, which, however,
nobody saw, inasmuch as the place was all covered
with herbage. But this was done," says the shrewd
Malespini, merely for appearance sake,—'<i>per dare
colore all'arrosto</i>.' "This done, he fenced the circle
around with a piece of a ship's cable, leaving a narrow
entrance, at which was placed a moderate sized bell.
On the right hand were two large brasiers filled with
burning coals; and on the left a filbert wand, and a
vase full of drugs for fumigations. When all this was
arranged, he brought the Grand Duke and the rest
within the circle, imposing on them silence with solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
gestures; and then requested that one among them
would stand forward and assist him in doing what was
needed, assuring them, very seriously, that no harm
should happen to him."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FLORENCE NIGHT.</div>

<p>"At this Signor Sansonetto d'Avernia at once stepped
forward and offered himself. The necromancer made
him take off his shoes, and caused all the others to lay
aside their arms. He then placed Sansonetto between
the two brasiers, with the knife in one hand, which had
been previously used for the formation of the circle,
and in his other the filbert rod, which he directed him
to hold stretched forth threateningly, while he stood
erect and drawn up to his full height. Now Sansonetto
was a very tall man, and extremely corpulent withal,
with a very red face, like another Bacchus. So that
the Grand Duke, seeing him standing there barefoot,
with the knife raised in the air, and the brasiers on
either side of him, could not forbear laughing, in which
the necromancer had much ado not to join."</p>

<p>"When due gravity had been restored, the Grand
Duke was placed in the centre, on a black velvet
cushion, and all the others around the circle. All
having taken their seats, the necromancer turning to
the east, uttered a very loud whistle, and repeated the
same towards the north, the south, and the west. It
was now an hour and a half after sunset, and quite
dark, so that the scene was visible only by the lurid
light of the brasiers, which much favoured the effect
intended to be produced. The wizard then took the
bell, and ringing it loud and long, cried, 'Come
hither! come hither! all spirits who owe me obedience!'
And turning to the north he called 'Bardicul!
Stuflogor! Solsibec! Graffaril! Tarmidar!
Zampir! and Borgamur!' And when he had called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
these ridiculous names, which were the first (says
Malespini, who seems rather an <i>esprit fort</i>) that came
into his mouth, he turned to Sansonetto, and bade
him throw the drugs on the braziers. These drugs
were compounded of assafœtida, pitch, sulphur, and
other stinking and abominable ingredients, and the
wizard's intention was, that a small portion only should
be thrown on the coals. But poor Sansonetto, in his
zeal, threw such a quantity into the braziers, and raised
so dreadful and fœtid a smoke, that all had to hold
their noses, and it was almost impossible to endure it.
The dreadful stench filled all the garden, and reached
the nostrils of the lady Bianca, who, with some of her
most intimate friends, was placed so that they could
see all the sport without being seen. The necromancer
perceiving, therefore, that Sansonetto had
overdone the thing, and that the Grand Duke could
hardly bear the stench and the smoke, judged it best
to hasten to the catastrophe of his performance, instead
of prolonging it by various other ceremonies, as he had
intended. So he gave a concerted sign by thrice
clapping his hands; whereupon the devils (concealed
beneath the apparently unmoved surface of the soil)
began to make such noises and thunderings, that one
might have thought the end of the world was at hand,
and the infernal regions opening beneath their feet.
Dreadful cries and lamentations, strange howlings,
gnashing of teeth, clanking of chains, sighs and groans,
were heard; and innumerable flames of fire burst forth
from holes made in the earth, so that the grass was
burned by them. In truth, to anybody not in the
secret, the scene must have been," thinks Malespini,
"shocking and terrible in no small degree."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FLORENCE NIGHT.</div>

<p>"And, indeed, when the party heard all this horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
tumult, many, I promise you, were frightened enough,
and thought no more of the stinking smoke in their
alarm. Then the necromancer thought it time to
bring about his catastrophe. Stamping with his foot
therefore, he gave the sign agreed on for the letting
go the chains that supported over the pit beneath the
platform with the soil and grass on which they were
all sitting. The brasiers and the knife were dexterously
removed outside the circle by the necromancer.
But the whole of the party were precipitated pell–mell
one over the other into the pit; much of the earth and
sods which had been ranged on the platform falling on
the top of them. If the previous circumstances had
frightened them, let anybody judge," says our chronicler,
"how much more they were terrified now, finding
themselves all precipitated, with the Grand Duke
in the midst, into the bowels of the earth. In short
there was not one of them, as they afterwards confessed,
who did not firmly believe that they had looked
their last on the light of the sun."</p>

<p>"No sooner had they fallen thus into the pit, than
the devils were upon them, making noises more horrible
than before, and looking fearfully hideous in the
lurid light of the flames that continually blazed forth.
So that in truth the poor fellows were beside themselves
with terror, and hardly knew if they were alive
or dead."</p>

<p>"When they were thus in an agony of alarm and distress,
there suddenly appeared a number of beautiful
girls, who in some degree mitigated the stink of the
smoke by delicious odours that they brought with them.
Taking the Grand Duke and the others by the hand,
they led them out of the horrible pit, comforting them,"
writes Malespini, "with amorous gestures and pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
manners, and conducted them to the arcades that were
in the garden. There they were restored by the
exquisite odour which proceeded from a large golden
lamp, that cast a soft light over all the arcade. And
while they were admiring these beauties, who were," as
the author somewhat contradictorily writes, "all naked,
with gold brocaded mantles magnificently adorned with
precious stones, the music of various instruments was
heard, and angelic and divine voices carolled forth the
words of certain hymns appropriate to the matter in
hand. So that it really appeared to all present, that
the whole hierarchy of paradise was there assembled.
When the Grand Duke and his companions looked
about them and saw a magnificently arranged banquet,
with beautiful fruits of every kind, they could not but
think themselves in the Elysian fields. Then the
nymphs with infinite grace and charm of manner
pressed them to rest and repose themselves; and the
Grand Duke pretended (observe), to recover himself
and collect his senses after so great an astonishment;
and said to his companions, the Count Santafiora, the
two Strozzi, and Altoviti, 'Let the meaning of all
this be what it may, I think, for my part, that all these
good things are not to be despised, and still less so
these charming and amiable ladies.'"</p>

<p>"As for the others of the party, they had remained in
the pit half dead, lying there insensible, till they were
carried to beds prepared for the purpose, where they
were properly attended by medical men provided for
that end."</p>

<p>"As soon as the Grand Duke had spoken as above, a
voice was heard to sing an ode," duly recorded by
Malespini, but which the reader may be spared, in
which the flattery of his highness is piled as only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Italian hyperbole can pile it. "Meantime, the beautiful
and elegant girls," says the writer, "among whom was
one of exceeding loveliness, named Milla Capraia, did
not cease to caress those noble knights; till suddenly
another strophe was heard beginning 'Depart, oh noble
heroes!' &amp;c., and so the diversion came to a conclusion."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE'S HEROISM.</div>

<p>Such, considerably abridged, is the account of
Bianca's mode of entertaining her guests among the
classic shades where Lorenzo's Platonists had speculated,
and Macchiavelli had stirred the patriotism of
the last free sons of Florence.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth remarking, that the words to
which the readers attention was called,—"the Grand
Duke <i>pretended</i> to recover himself"—seem to show,
that <i>he</i> was in the secret of the performances all the
time; and that the zest of the joke consisted in
frightening the silly courtiers out of their wits, while
their magnanimous sovereign should enjoy their discomfiture,
himself <i>seeming</i> to be superior to all such
terrors; and should be worshipped as a hero on the
strength thereof by Miss Milla Capraia, who was to
<i>seem</i> to put perfect faith in his heroism.</p>

<p>But while Bianca and the Grand Duke and the court
were thus amusing themselves, a very different scene
was passing in that corner of the huge pile of the
Pitti palace, which contained the private apartments
of the Duchess. At first the birth of her son had
been a matter of immense rejoicing and triumph to
the unhappy woman. The consequent retirement of
Bianca had been a precious balm to her long mortified
pride; and she had flattered herself that at last
brighter days were before her, and that the mother of
the heir to his crown would at least be held of some
account in her husband's court, if not in his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>But gradually all these hopes failed her. Not only
did the odious rival return, as we have seen, and
recover all her previous ascendancy, but the arrival of
her brother Vittorio, and the marked favour immediately
shown to him by the Grand Duke, who received
him as he might have done a visitor of princely rank,
seemed to prove, that there was no hope of her being
able to struggle against Francesco's infatuated affection
for his mistress. The unhappy princess was expecting
to be again confined in the spring of 1578, when
these sorrows threw her back into the melancholy from
which she had been for a brief space roused by the
short–lived reconciliation with her husband. And there
is little doubt that they contributed<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> to produce the

11th of May, 1578.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Giovanna was not endowed with the qualities calculated
to make her popular with the people of her
adopted country. The cold Austrian nature, the
absence of all personal charm, the pride of a scion of
the house of Austria, so different in its kind from the
lighter boastful vaingloriousness of their own princes,
the haughty reserve and stiff ceremonial manners of
the daughter of the line of Hapsburg, were uncongenial
and disagreeable to the Florentines. A breaking
heart, moreover, whose sorrows had to be hidden under
a veil of courtly etiquette, was not calculated to improve
these deficiencies. Notwithstanding all this, however,
the too manifest unhappiness of her life, her dignified
bearing under her misfortunes, the propriety of her
conduct under strong temptation to act otherwise, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
conciliated to her the sympathy and respect, if not the
love, of all classes of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIOVANNA'S DEATH.</div>

<p>It was known that on her death–bed she had
repeatedly<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> implored the Grand Duke, for his honour
and conscience' sake, to separate himself from the
woman who had rendered her life so miserable, declaring
at the same time that she freely pardoned her
for all the ill she had suffered at her hands. And
these circumstances, combined with the intense hatred
which all Florence nourished for her unworthy rival,
"the witch" Bianca, caused her death to be sincerely
mourned by the entire city. And almost every writer
of the period has a word of sympathy and pity for this
one among the many victims of Medicean cruelty and
crime.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">What is Francesco to do now?—The Cardinal and Bianca try another
fall.—Cardinal down again.—Francesco's vengeance.—What does the
Church say?—Bianca at Bologna.—The marriage privately performed.—The
Cardinal learns the secret.—The daughtership of St. Mark.—Venetian
doings <i>versus</i> Venetian sayings.—Embassy to Florence.—Suppose
we could have her crowned.—The marriage publicly
solemnised.</p>

<p class="pn p2">What were Francesco's feelings on the death of his
unloved wife? His conduct towards her had more
than once got him into serious trouble with the
Imperial Court. Little as he had heeded outraging
her feelings, and parading his neglect of her before
the world of Florence, still his intercourse with Bianca
had been hampered by the necessity of making some
little show of decency in the eyes of foreign courts.
He had been obliged to have "riguardi," as the Italian
phrase goes. Then Giovanna had been an expensive
wife; far more so than Francesco liked. And now
the cost of the magnificent obsequies, which were to
lay her dust under the gorgeous dome of San Lorenzo,
would be the closing article in that account.</p>

<p>Francesco was now free. Yet despite all these
considerations, it may be very much doubted whether
the death of his wife was matter of such unmixed
contentment to him as it might at first sight seem to
be. Now became due that bill drawn on futurity, that
fatal promise to Bianca,—uttered "before an image,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
too, to make the matter worse,—that, should the time
ever come, when they were both free, she should
become his wife. It seems likely enough, that a
feeling, which he may have mistaken for repentance,
came over him in these days, when he thought on the
slaughter of Bonaventuri.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROMISE.</div>

<p>It was not that the Grand Duke felt any repugnance
in his own heart to perform his promise. His liking
for his mistress seems to have been as strong or
stronger than ever, and he wished sincerely to be
married to her. But he hesitated to face the storm of
disapprobation, which would follow the perpetration of
such a mesalliance throughout Europe—the dismay of
friends, the exultation of enemies, the discontent of
his subjects, the ridicule of all. As for his promise,
image and all, Francesco was not the man to be much
troubled with any such bonds, if it suited his convenience
to break them. He would have been bold
enough to brave the resentment of any dead Saint in
the calendar. But there was a living sinner, of whom
he stood in considerably greater awe. How could he
refuse to Bianca to keep the promise she had extorted,
and the performance of which she would assuredly not
now be weaker in exacting.</p>

<p>When the personal wishes of such a man as Francesco,
strong only in wilfulness, and the determined
will of such a woman as Bianca were on one side, and
on the other only the fear of consequences, which
could so far be kept at a distance, as never to be
allowed to meet him face to face, it was little doubtful
what the upshot would be. The contumely of Europe,
and the reproaches of his family, might be effectually
prevented from reaching his ears. But how avoid the
nearer annoyances inseparable equally from living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
without Bianca, and from living with her, yet not
acceding to her just demands.</p>

<p>Still, for some time the disturbance of Francesco's
mind seems to have been extreme. Still, he let "I
dare not wait upon I would;" and lived the while in
a condition of miserable uncertainty and agitation.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
His first step after the death of Giovanna was to leave
Florence, where the universal lamentation for his
ill–fated wife disgusted him. Perhaps, also, during
this time of doubt and conflicting resolutions he was
glad to escape from the presence of Bianca. It seems
probable, indeed, from his conduct, that this was really
his wish for the moment. For instead of going to any
one of the numerous residences belonging to him in
different parts of Tuscany, he kept continually moving
from place to place, wandering through the least
frequented parts of his dominions.</p>

<p>The Cardinal, to whom the death of the Grand
Duchess had been a cause of serious grief and disquietude,
was much reassured by this apparent desire
on the part of Francesco to avoid the seductress at
this conjuncture. He went to Porto Ferraio in the
island of Elba in the hope of finding the Grand Duke
there, and thus getting the opportunity of conferring
with him at a distance from the influences with which
Bianca in general contrived to surround him. Francesco,
however, avoided any such interview with his
brother; and the Cardinal had to content himself with
sending a secretary, in whom he could confide, to urge
those considerations on the Grand Duke, which he
would fain have set before him in person. The
messenger caught the Duke in Serravezza, a little hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
village high up among the Apennines, and then one of
the most remote spots in the Duchy, though now well–known
as giving its name to the neighbouring marble
quarries, which rival those of Carrara in the quality of
their produce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRANCESCO AT SERRAVEZZA.</div>

<p>The instructions of Ferdinand's envoy were to move
Francesco by every possible consideration to marry
again, choosing his wife from among the princesses of
those sovereign houses whose friendship might be
useful for the sustaining of the family greatness.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> It
is clear, therefore, that whatever may have been the
case at a later period, Ferdinand had not yet conceived
the desire that his brother's inheritance might fall on
him. Up to this time he was evidently labouring
sincerely in the cause of Francesco's credit and honour,
and all his schemes for the aggrandisement of the
family were centred in the Grand Duke, and in the
hope of his leaving legitimately born heirs male of
sovereign lineage to succeed him.</p>

<p>But his messenger brought him back an account of
his interview with the Grand Duke, which seems to
have very much changed the course of his policy and
conduct for the future. Francesco would not hear of
contracting any such new marriage as was proposed to
him. He professed indeed his determination not to
marry again at all. But the secretary was able to
detail to his master, certain little indications gleaned
from the phrases or the actions of the Duke, which
led the acute Cardinal to the conviction that Francesco
had already made up his mind to marry Bianca. And
from thenceforth the Cardinal very manifestly changed
his conduct. He no longer made any attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
preserve even that outward appearance of family
union, which he had hitherto, despite all difficulties
and provocations, succeeding in maintaining. He
quarrelled with his brother openly and publicly; and
in all the political manœuvrings for the petty objects
arising out of the jealousies of the Italian princely
houses, which made up the life occupation of the
cardinals living in the Roman court, he thenceforth
took a line of his own, wholly distinct from, and in
some respects opposed to that of his brother, and the
general Medicean family interest. He, for instance,
began to cultivate a friendship with the court of
France, between which and Francis, who had always
inclined to that of Spain, there had ever been enmity.</p>

<p>Just about this time especially, he was on ill terms
with France, which had been guilty of injuring him in
one of the tenderest points in which the feelings of a
despotic prince such as Francesco can be touched. She
had accorded protection to fugitives from his vengeance.
Several of those who had been implicated in the Pucci
conspiracy, such as Antonio and Piero Capponi, and
Bernardo Girolami, as well as Troilo Orsini, with
whose guilt we have had occasion to become acquainted,
had escaped thither, and lived unmolested under the
protection of France. This was intolerable to Francesco.
It was not so much the feeling of pique and
jealousy which might exist between two governments
on the subject of harbouring each other's outlaws, and
which may well be a ground of legitimate remonstrance
and discontent between neighbouring nations; for
such a grievance can be remedied only by inducing
the offending government to give up the refugees to
the legal tribunals of their own country. What
rankled in Francesco's heart was simply the frustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
of his personal vengeance. And the measures which
he adopted were accordingly directed wholly to the
gratification of that feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE'S VENGEANCE.</div>

<p>One Curzio Picchena was at that time secretary to
the Florentine embassy at Paris, and to him was
entrusted the execution of the Grand Duke's hitherto
baulked revenge. He was directed to hire assassins
to murder the above–named fugitives and others, at the
price of four thousand ducats per murder. And he
was furnished from Florence with poisons, the choice
produce of the poison–laboratory established by Cosmo
in the Uffizi, as one of the necessary institutions of
statecraft, both for drugging the victims in case that
should be found the preferable mode of proceeding,
and for poisoning the weapons of the hired assassins
if that course appeared more practicable!<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> So carefully
provident was this Medicean proficient in the
arcana of kingcraft!</p>

<p>Girolami was accordingly assassinated. But his
fate warned the others of their danger; and some fled
into the provinces, and some to England. It was
then judged, says the Italian historian, that Italian
cut–throats would be found more capable in their
calling. Of these masters in their art then, some were
sent into France, and some to England; and these,
unlike the French bunglers, soon gave their sovereign
all the satisfaction he craved.</p>

<p>Such were the cares of State, which contributed to
burthen the Grand Ducal mind, already sorely
oppressed by the necessity of deciding what was
to be done in the matter of Bianca and her claims.
The agitation of his mind manifested itself in bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
restlessness; and he continued to ramble about his
dominions, while Bianca, thus prevented from seeing
him, kept up an unceasing battery of letters. At
length he hit upon the common refuge of imbecility,
and determined to throw upon other shoulders the
task of decision, which he found too arduous for his
own. So he summoned an able theologian, reputed—undeservedly,
as the result clearly indicates—to be a
thorough master of his business; and, confiding to him
his difficulties, the promise he had made, and his own
private desire to fulfil it, demanded to be told what it
was his duty to do.</p>

<p>Now it would surely seem clear enough to any one
conversant with the duties of court chaplains, what was
the course to take after such an exposition of the case
as this. And to a plain man, ignorant of canonical
statute law, and incapacitated by his low estate from
comprehending the difference between princely honour
and vulgar individuals' honour, it would surely seem
that Francesco's moral and religious duty was to keep
his promise and marry his mistress. But not so
judged the able theologian. He pointed out, with all
the eloquence of perfect climax, that such a marriage
would be uncanonical, void, disreputable, and inexpedient.
And, forgetting the broad hint given him by
the gracious sovereign as to his own wishes in the
matter, he pushed his zeal for canon law and blood–royal
propriety so far as to convince the Duke against
his will, with the ordinary result of such convictions.</p>

<p>But Bianca, as usual, showed herself in this crisis
also, perfectly equal to the occasion. As soon as ever
she learned that Francesco had taken it into his head
to look at the matter in a theological point of view,
she took immediate means of insuring a supply of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
theological support from the most influential and effectual
source. Francesco's own confessor was a Franciscan
friar, he at least being the right man in the right
place. To him Bianca found means of pointing out that
the bishopric of Chiusi happened to be just then vacant.
And the result of that communication was, that the
Duke was very easily led to see all the professional
mistakes committed by his previous adviser, and to
arrive at the desired conclusion, that the Church and
his duty required him to do exactly that which his own
wishes prompted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COSA DI FRANCESCO.</div>

<p>While theology was thus at work in her favour,
Bianca was not idle on her own behalf. She was continually
writing to the Grand Duke, and sometimes
contrived to have news to tell him, tending to show
how entirely their connection was recognised publicly,
and respected. Thus we find from a MS.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> record of
the time, that she was at Bologna in the course of this
spring with her daughter Pellegrina, and her son–in–law
Ulisse Bentivoglio; and that she was received
there with public honours, having been escorted into
the city by a large company of the principal nobility,
both cavaliers <i>and ladies</i>, "out of respect for the Grand
Duke of Florence, seeing that the said Bianca was
property of his—<i>sua cosa</i>." Surely it would be difficult
to conceive a more striking mark of the degradation of
a people, of their fitness to be slaves and unfitness to be
anything else, than this going forth of the patricians of a
great city to do honour to a prince's "cosa!" This, however,
was of course not Bianca's reading of the incident,
and its significance. Surely a "cosa" so received was
worthy to become a wife! In short, writing sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
in one tone and sometimes in another, she ceased not
to pour in a well–sustained fire of letters,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> till at last,
just when her ally the friar was convincing his penitent
that it was his duty to marry her, she threw in a final
missive, full of pathetic resignation to his will, and
intimations of her own intention not to survive her
disappointment.</p>

<p>The game so well played was won. Francesco
finally agreed to the marriage. But as Bianca was
very strongly of opinion that, "if it were done when
'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly," and
as it was impossible to celebrate the marriage openly
within a month or two of the death of the Grand
Duchess, it was determined that it should take place
privately, and be kept profoundly secret till the following
year.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the marriage was duly performed on
the 5th of June, 1578, in the <i>Palazzo Vecchio</i>, by the
same convenient Franciscan friar who had worked so
well to bring it about. The date of this event has
been erroneously stated by various writers; but it is
ascertained with certainty from a copy of the original
certificate signed by "Frater Masseus Antonii de
Bardis," which is preserved in a MS. of the Marciana
library, cited by Cigogna.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The witnesses were a
brother Franciscan monk, and Don Pandolfo de' Bardi,
a relative of the Duke's confessor. The same document
states that the ceremony was performed "in
majori palatio," in the <i>Palazzo Vecchio</i>, as it is now
called. And if it should chance that the reader has
seen the chapel of that venerable pile, it will recur to
his recollection as a most fitting spot for the celebration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of any rite intended to be concealed from all eyes.
It is inaccessible, except through other apartments of
the palace; so small, as barely to admit the parties
whose presence was necessary to the ceremony; and,
though most richly decorated, so dark, that the features
of those standing within it can barely be recognised by
each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT FROM THE CARDINAL.</div>

<p>In this secret spot the Franciscan friar performed
the rite which, in homely English phrase, made an
honest woman of Bianca; a feat which—to recur to
the words already quoted—"if it were done when 'tis
done"—surely deserved the reward of the bishopric of
Chiusi, or any other whatsoever.</p>

<p>So secret was the marriage kept, that even the lynx–eyed
spies of the Cardinal had no suspicion of it. And
he still continued,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> despite his open quarrel with his
brother, to make overtures in various Courts, in the
hope of arranging some suitable marriage for him, for
months after Bianca had made good her hold on
him,—labours of her capable and crafty enemy which
must, it may be supposed, have amused that lady not
a little to witness.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1579 the Duke fell ill, and was
at one time supposed to be in some danger; which
furnished a pretext and opportunity to the Cardinal to
visit his brother, with a view of getting at the truth
respecting his position. For Francesco's steady refusal
of the proposals made to him, and some other circumstances,
had led him to conceive suspicions on the
subject.</p>

<p>He found his brother ill in bed, exclusively attended
by Bianca, to his great annoyance and disgust. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
seized the first opportunity of reading the sick man a
strong lecture on the impropriety, and even risk, of
allowing that infamous woman to have the charge of
his sick room. Whereupon Francesco felt himself
obliged to let the secret out, and acknowledge that
"the infamous woman" was Grand Duchess of
Tuscany.</p>

<p>Ferdinand dissembled the excess of his sorrow and
indignation at this confession, and remained with his
brother till he was out of danger. But it is recorded,
that when he repeated the fact to his confidential secretary,
he could not refrain from tears of mortification;
and he returned to Rome with a fresh accumulation of
anger against his brother, and of the bitterest hatred
for the woman, to whom he attributed the disgrace of
his family, and the ruin of his well–plotted and laboriously
prosecuted schemes for its aggrandisement.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke meanwhile, having recovered his
health, continued to keep his marriage secret till the
middle of April, when the year of mourning for his
former wife was completed. Then his first care was to
communicate the fact to his friend and patron, Philip
of Spain, intimating that he awaited only his approval
to publish it to all the courts. Philip, thinking probably
that it mattered little whom a trading, plebeian–descended
Medici married, gave his gracious approbation.
But still one more step remained to be taken
before making the public announcement to all Europe.
Anxious to find some means of gilding a little, if
possible, the ignoble object of his choice, he sent an
embassy to Venice, informing the senate of his
intention, in a highly flattering letter, to the effect
that he considered the lady a daughter of the Republic,
and that it is his hope in uniting himself to her, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
become a son of Venice, and ever to show himself such
to the republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAUGHTER OF ST. MARK.</div>

<p>This embassy entrusted by Francesco to the Count
Mario Strozzi of Santafiora, was received with every
possible demonstration of respect and satisfaction by
the Venetians. Santafiora was escorted into the city
with public honours. Forty senators were deputed to
wait on him in the name of the Republic. The Cappello
palace was assigned to him as a residence, and he
was received at the door of it by the Patriarch of
Aquileia, the greatest man of the family connection.
Bianca's father and brother were made cavalieri,
dubbed "illustrissimi," and entitled to precedence over
all other members of the order. In the gala doings
which accompanied these events the Queen of the
Adriatic outdid herself, we are told, in feasts and
magnificence.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> By a unanimous vote of the Senate on
the 16th of June, in consideration of "the Grand Duke
of Tuscany having chosen for his wife Bianca Cappello,
of a most noble family in this city, a lady adorned
with all those most excellent and singular qualities,
which make her most worthy of any the highest
fortune, it is ordered that she be created a true and
particular daughter of the Republic."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The same
decree orders a golden chain of the value of a thousand
dollars to be given to Francesco's ambassador. Moreover,
all unpleasant memorials of the time before the
lady's most excellent and signal qualities had been
discovered, were ordered, as we have seen, to be erased
from the public registers.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand all this excessive avidity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
of toad–eating servility and flunkeyism in such a body
as the Venetian senate. But a few months previously
they had manifested a very different tone of feeling on
the subject of Bianca's connection with the Grand
Duke, superior alike to any sentiments to be found
among the Florentine nobles, and to these their own
subsequent acts. For we read in a MS. chronicle of
the time by Francesco Molino, cited by Cigogna,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> that
Bartolommeo Cappello, her father, having purchased
the magnificent palace De' Trivigiani with money
received from his daughter, was so ill–looked on in
Venice in consequence, that he was solely on this
account excluded from the senate; "inasmuch as it
was thought that the connection of that family with
the Prince Francesco arose from a base and disgraceful
cause; and that though it might be profitable, and
might, perhaps, be deemed honourable for others, it
was not so for a Venetian gentleman."</p>

<p>That last touch of republican pride is magnificent;
and it is a pity that any reasons of policy, or other
motive of any kind, should have induced the senate to
exhibit itself so lamentably false to all such generous
feeling so shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Francesco was exceedingly delighted at the abundant
success of his embassy to Venice. Bianca now was—no,
not <i>was</i> exactly—but might be supposed to seem
to be, no longer a private individual, but a princess, as
being the daughter of a sovereign state. By metaphor,
fiction, parchment, and herald's trumpeting, Bianca
was now a princess, of due rank to mate with a sovereign
duke; and Francesco accordingly announced to
the various courts on the 20th of June his forthcoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
marriage with a daughter of the republic of Venice.
The ceremony was fixed for the 12th of October, 1579;
and immense preparations were made to celebrate it
with unusual pomp and splendour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENETIAN EMBASSY TO FLORENCE.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Grand Duke sent his natural brother,
Don Giovanni, a boy of twelve years old, with a
numerous train, to bear his thanks to the Republic for
the honours conferred on his bride. He was received
by eight–and–twenty Venetian gentlemen at the frontier,
and by forty senators outside the city, by whom he
was processionally conducted to the Casa Cappello,
where Vittorio, Bianca's brother, was charged by the
senate to entertain him at the expense of the state,
which granted an unlimited credit for that purpose.
Under these circumstances it may be safely conjectured
that the boy ambassador was received with
such holiday keeping, as left on his mind no mean impressions
of Venetian hospitality and magnificence.</p>

<p>On the 28th of September arrived in Florence the
ambassadors sent by Venice "to put," says Galluzzi,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
"Bianca in possession of the prerogatives which the
daughtership of St. Mark produced to her." It is
rather difficult to understand what these prerogatives
might have been; but it is probable that if the baggage
of the ambassadors had been searched for them, they
would have been found to consist in a certain quantity
of engrossed parchment and sealing–wax, cased in some
more or less splendidly adorned wrappage of velvet or
cloth of gold.</p>

<p>The ambassadors, however, Antonio Tiepolo and
Giovanni Michiel, were assisted in bringing these
"prerogatives" by a train of ninety gentlemen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
noblest houses in Venice. It was apparently thought
necessary that the extrinsic pomp of this embassy
should be in exact proportion to the intrinsic meanness
of the business it was engaged on. For we are told
that it outshone in taste and magnificence all former
doings of the kind, even in the most palmy days of
Venice. And all the ninety noble gentlemen who
came to make <i>kotoo</i> to Francesco's <i>cosa</i>, vied with each
other in efforts of ostentation for the manifestation of
their, own greatness.</p>

<p>Beside these ninety, there came also the bride's
father and brother, and the Patriarch of Aquileia, by
no means behindhand, the holy man, in availing
himself of his scrap of relationship to the "cosa," for
the purpose of bringing his grey hairs into the sunshine
of a princely countenance. And with these came other
eighty, all calling themselves relations of the bride;
and all were lodged in the Pitti palace, and treated
with all sorts of junkettings and diversions, banquets,
balls, tourneys, hunting–parties (with nets), bull–baiting,
chariot races, comedies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The task of thus entertaining his wife's relatives on
this occasion is computed to have cost Francesco three
hundred thousand ducats,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> a sum which, allowing for
the difference in the value of money, seems almost
incredible. It happened to be a year of great scarcity
in Tuscany. There was wide–spread and severe distress
among the people, who looked on at this lavish
and useless expenditure; and the sight did not contribute
to conciliate the love of the Florentines to their
new liege lady.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CORONATION.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, in the interval between the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
the ambassadors in Florence, and the day appointed
for the ceremony, it occurred to Francesco,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> that the
daughtership of St. Mark might be turned to better
account yet. There had been two other daughters of
St. Mark, one the wife of a king of Hungary, and the
other Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus. Now, why
should not Bianca also be crowned, as a daughter of
the Republic. It would have a very good effect as part
of the ceremony at all events, and might very likely
pass with many persons for more than it really was.
Crowning is crowning; and whether the crown to be
placed on Bianca's head was that of St. Mark's
daughter, or <i>that of a Grand Duchess of Tuscany</i>,
might very easily be little observed or questioned.</p>

<p>The Venetian Senate on their part consented willingly
to permit the ambassadors at Francesco's
request to perform this ceremony in their name, but
were quite awake to the same probability of error, and
were anxious that their crowning of their daughter
should be known to be their deed, and the dignity one
of their bestowing. So the letter, by which they
authorise Tiepolo and Michiel to comply with Francesco's
wish enjoins, that in placing the crown on her
head, "it shall be proclaimed in a loud voice, that it
is in sign of her being a true and particular daughter
of our Republic." And a second letter charges them
to take care, that those words are so said "as to be
distinctly heard by all around, and in such a manner
that they be not drowned by any noise of trumpets or
otherwise."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>But there was also another person in Florence, who
pricked up his ears, and had a word to say in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
matter, when he heard a talk of crowning going on.
This was the Pope's nuncio, who protested that all
crowning appertained to his master. And it was
necessary to quiet him by pointing out and declaring
explicitly, that what was proposed was no crowning of
a Grand Duchess, but merely a token of the daughtership
of St. Mark. And he also was anxious that this
fact should be clearly avowed and understood.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, however, many chroniclers
contemporary and other, have written that Bianca was
crowned Grand Duchess of Tuscany.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Perhaps the
Florentine trumpets and shoutings contrived to make
the words of the Venetian functionary inaudible
despite his efforts to obey the senate and make himself
heard.</p>

<p>The ceremony began on the appointed day in the
great hall of the <i>Palazzio Vecchio</i>—the same hall in
which Capponi had persuaded the Florentines to elect
Jesus Christ for their king, and Savonarola had
instructed the great council of the nation to abstain
from debating, in order the more swiftly to act on his
suggestion. In that famous old hall, once the very
cradle of Italian freedom, and the heart of the popular
life, a throne was built for the prince by right divine;—right
truly and absolutely divine of those eternal
laws, which make such princes the natural result of
the lack of wisdom and worth, and excess of evil and
unruly passions which had been exhibited in the
councils of that council–chamber. The ungainly irregularity
in the form of the enormous hall may have in
some measure marred the symmetry of the upholstery
magnificences. But Francesco and Bianca should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
have been well content to pardon any such eyesore.
For the fashion all awry of that home of the old
Republic, in which no wall makes a right angle with its
neighbour, commemorates literally, as well as typically,
the implacable internecine party hatreds of the Florentines.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
And had that stone embodiment of the
spirit of the old Italian commonwealths been able to
be built straight, Florence would not have had that
day to stand abject, vicious, and degraded to bow
before a despot and his ... <i>cosa</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CEREMONY.</div>

<p>When the prince was seated, and all his military,
legal and clerical flunkeys in their proper liveries, duly
ranged around him, Bianca was led in by the ambassadors
of Venice; and floods of speechifying, easy to
be imagined, but intolerable to read, were uttered by
the various functionaries of either nation. Probably
if might be difficult for the strictest analysis to detect
one particle of truth in all that was said. To Grimani,
the old patriarch of Aquileia, it fell to make an
oration "on the utility of this marriage and the value
of the daughtership of St. Mark." The two ambassadors
did their crowning; but in some way or other
failed to do it to the satisfaction of the Senate. For
when they, in accordance with Venetian law, asked
permission to keep the present of a ring worth fifteen
hundred dollars, given to each of them by Francesco,
it was refused.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>When the business had been got through thus far,
Bianca was carried,—chaired, it should seem like a
newly elected M.P.,—with the crown on her head to
the cathedral; and there were done "sacred sacrifices,"
"divine services," and other such unbounded lying of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
an intensified, infinite, and yet more pernicious sort
than that previously perpetrated in the lay part of the
business.</p>

<p>And so Bianca was made a Duchess—nay Grand
Duchess; and stepped triumphantly on her <i>excelsior</i>
path, rewarded by success for her long efforts, patient
endurance, sleepless astute vigilance, courageous battling
with danger and difficulty, and unscrupulous
daring.</p>

<p>Honesty the best policy! Policy, for what object?
Not for scaling the throne of a Grand Duchess apparently!</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">Bianca's new policy.—New phase of the battle between the Woman and
the Priest.—Serene, or, not serene! that is the question.—Bianca
protests against sisters.—Death of the child Filippo.—Bianca's
troubles and struggles.—The villa of Pratolino.—Francesco's extraordinary
mode of life there.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The ninety embassy–followers, and the eighty kinsmen,
were kind enough to give Francesco the pleasure
of their company for some time after the marriage;
but towards the end of October they returned to Venice,
carrying with them presents of collars of gold and
jewels. The Patriarch had his full share of gifts,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and
all the swarm of the relatives "proportionably." But
father–in–law Bartolommeo carried off not only very large
sums of money, but a good pension for life. Brother–in–law
Vittorio declined to return to Venice any more
at all, purposing to devote himself wholly to the service
of his august kinsman. A large pension, not for life,
but to him and his heirs for ever (!), and a dower for
his daughter, was the least that could reward such zeal.
Bianca's pin–money was fixed at an hundred thousand
ducats, to be invested in the mint of Venice.</p>

<p>What were the feelings being stored up the while in
the breasts of the Florentines in their dearth and
famine time towards Bianca, may be imagined. And
when it is remembered, that one of Francesco's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
strongest passions was avarice, the excess of all this
munificence towards Bianca, and her belongings, may
help to give us the measure of the influence that she
had acquired over him. Yes! it must be admitted that
Bianca had decidedly succeeded!</p>

<p>Hitherto we have seen the Cardinal Ferdinando and
his new sister–in–law open and inveterate enemies; and
the former at each critical point of the war between them
has been beaten. During the period of her struggle to
win her footing in the family, she judged it necessary
to her success, that Francesco and his brother should be
at enmity. But now, that her position as a member
of the house of Medici was indefeasibly won, and its
interests were her interests, she was anxious to bring
about a reconciliation with her brother–in–law.</p>

<p>She opened her new campaign by inducing her
husband to change his manner towards his brother.
Francesco had always manifested his irritation under
the politic Cardinal's sermons and remonstrances, by
treating him on all the occasions, when business matters
made it necessary for them to communicate, with
the greatest rudeness and discourtesy. Under Bianca's
management, all this soon disappeared. She was able
also to bring about a change which affected Ferdinando
yet more sensibly. His magnificent and ostentatious
habits caused him always to be in difficulties; and
he was very frequently desirous of being allowed to
anticipate a little his drafts on his Florentine appanage.
This Francesco, rejoicing in an opportunity of spiting
his respectable brother, had always, in the most disobliging
manner, refused. <i>Now</i> it is intimated to our
good brother, that if it should be convenient to him to
anticipate his revenues a little, the Grand Duke will be
delighted to accommodate him. Then the clever lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
finds the means of entering into an epistolary commerce
with this highly respectable churchman, who had so
sedulously kept her and her abominations from coming
between the wind and his propriety. And it is not
without considerable elevation of the eyebrows that we
find her writing to him on the 24th of December,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
1580, in such terms as the following:</p>


<div class="sidenote">PATTE DE VELOURS.</div>

<p>"I live," she assures him, "more for you than for
myself. Indeed, I live but in you, for I cannot live
without you;"—which, as the historian observes, are
"very cordial expressions." We shall be justified,
however, in assuming that, despite their "cordiality,"
they were not accurately expressive of the fact; even
if we do not go the length of supposing, as many narrators
of Bianca's story do, that they express the exact
contrary of the fact, we may probably also safely
conclude further, that the Cardinal did not believe more
of them than we do. And, indeed, it seems difficult to
suppose that Bianca should have expected him to
believe them. Nevertheless, the dexterous lady's civilities,
and <i>patte de velours</i>, did so far prevail, that to
the exceeding surprise of all Florence, and to the great
dismay of the anti–Medicean faction among the cardinals
at Rome, Ferdinando made his appearance in
Florence to spend the "villeggiatura" with his brother
in the autumn of 1510. Francesco was all kindness
and as generous as his ungracious nature would permit
him to be, and Bianca the perfection of amiability and
deferential affection. The Cardinal was perfectly ready,
and well pleased to sacrifice, if not the reality of his
deep resentment, at least the outward manifestation of
it, to the political objects which were interfered with by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the open schism in the family; and the reconciliation
appeared to be complete.</p>

<p>But from this time forward, the vantage–ground in
the long battle between the woman and the churchman
was no longer, as it had hitherto been, on the side of
the former. Whether it were, that the tactics adapted
to a state of open warfare were better suited to the
violent and daring, though by no means sincere nature
of Bianca, while the profound dissimulation of hatred,
under the mask of friendship, was more congenial to
the habits of the politic and respectable churchman,
the fact is, that the Grand Duchess had gained her
last victory, and that at every subsequent turn of the
game the Cardinal had the upper hand, till her final
discomfiture left him triumphant master of the field.</p>

<p>For the present, however, it perfectly suited both
parties to act in concert with reference to the great
object of Medicean state policy, which was then occupying
Francesco, and may be, indeed, said to have been
the leading aim and interest of his life.</p>

<p>His father, Duke Cosmo, by dint of assiduous obsequiousness
to Pope Pius V., and as the price of the
blood of his subjects, delivered over to the Inquisition
on charges of heresy, had obtained from that pontiff
the title of Grand Duke of Tuscany.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> But, as Sismondi
well observes,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> inasmuch as Tuscany was not, and had
never been a fief of the Church, the Pope could have
no sort of right to change the title of its sovereign.
Accordingly, both the Emperor, whose prerogatives
were thus infringed, and the other Italian Dukes,
above whom Cosmo sought to take rank by virtue of
this new title, refused to admit its validity. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Cosmo died while negotiations with the Emperor were
yet pending on the subject. But Francesco succeeded
in inducing the Emperor Maximilian II. to confer
on him the much desired title by a new decree, taking
no notice of the previous concession by the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MOST SERENE.</div>

<p>But even then, the other sovereigns of Italy would
not admit the precedence thus established in favour of
the Medici. Especially the haughty and ancient house
of Este could not brook that the plebeian upstarts,
whose fathers had been haggling for percentages, while
<i>their</i> ancestors had been defending their ancient fiefs
in the saddle, should now take rank in Europe above
them. The Duke of Savoy was equally determined to
dispute this promotion over his head; and the Duke of
Mantua thought the Gonzagas were as good as the
Medici any day.</p>

<p>The style and title attached to the grand–ducal dignity,
it seems, was "Most Serene Highness;" and it
was very easy for Francesco so to call and write
himself, and be called in his own duchy. But the
misery of the case was, that all the others forthwith
began to do the same. Not a dukeling of them would
any more be content to be a "Most Illustrious Excellency."
One after another all called themselves "Most
Serene" in the coolest manner; and it was even feared,
say the historians,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> that the little Republics would
begin to think themselves serene too.</p>

<p>Venice had, time out of mind, always been "most
serene," and was by all parties admitted to be so. But
the Queen of the Adriatic insisted upon being not only
most, but sole serene, and would give the coveted title
to none of the disputing parties. Once indeed, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
read, the Cardinal d'Este being at Venice, did somehow
manage to betray the Doge into speaking of his brother,
the reigning Duke of Ferrara, as "his Most Serene
Highness;" and great was the triumph of the House of
Este. But it was short; for the assembled senate
were much displeased at what their Doge had done;
and solemnly decreed that it was only a slip of the
tongue.</p>

<p>Meantime poor Francesco was, if anything, rather
worse off than all the illegitimate serene highnesses.
For those wicked and unprincipled confounders of all
distinctions agreed together to call each other serene,
while nobody would call him so. It was a cruel case;
and the Grand Duke, we read,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> shook with rage, at
the thought of all the trouble he had taken, and all
the money he had spent in procuring this title, only to
find himself after all no serener than his neighbours.</p>

<p>But the cruellest cut of all was to hear that some
of these vile pretenders had obtained recognition of
their false serenity at the court of France, at the hands
of a Medici, and she the head of his house! He sent
an envoy to Paris, who under pretext of asking payment
of certain moneys lent by him to Charles IX.,
was to see if the queen–mother could be got to favour
his views in the title question. But Catherine replied
to his first hint of the matter, that "she did not see
how she could do anything for the Grand Duke in that
business, seeing that he could give the King of Spain
a million of gold at a time, while with her and her
son, on the other hand, he looked after so small a
matter as that which they owed." The envoy humbly
observed that the King of Spain had not done his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
master the ill–turn in the title business which the
Queen had done. "And I did it on purpose,"
rejoined Catherine, "in return for the small respect
the Duke has paid me and my son, in committing
assassinations beneath our eyes. And you may write
to your master, that he do nothing of the sort again,
and specially that he lay hand on no man within this
realm; for the King, my son, will not endure it." So
Francesco took nothing by that motion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ARGUMENTUM AB INFERIORI.</div>

<p>He carried his complaints next to the Emperor
Rodolph II.; begging, that in the Diet shortly to be
held, some curb might be put on the usurpations
and abuses, which threatened, he said, to make all
equal, and leave no distinctions of rank at all. The
Duke of Urbino now asserted that he too was as serene
as his neighbours; and there was reason to fear that
the viceroy of Naples, and even the governor of
Milan, would soon be putting forth the same pretensions.
He urged on the consideration of the Emperor,
that "the distinction of ranks and precedences was so
necessary and profoundly based in the very nature of
things, that even in hell there were found to be such
distinctions among the devils and the damned."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> And
one cannot but feel the force of the argument in the
mouth of Francesco, that what was good for devils
must be good for dukes.</p>

<p>But the Duke of Savoy was also making remonstrances
to the Emperor. He boasted his descent
from the ancient family of Saxony; and argued,
remarkably enough, that this fact of German extraction
ought to assure him the primacy among all Italian
dukes. And it is worthy of note, that the Diet considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
such a claim well–founded, and in their report
to the Emperor begged him "to remember that the
Duke of Savoy was of German origin, and for that
reason to decree, that he should have precedence over
all the dukes of <i>that province</i>."—meaning thereby
simply Italy from the Alps to Calabria. The Duke of
Ferrara also sent envoys to the Emperor, imploring
him to think a little of the difference between his family
and that of the Medici, and to let him at least be
"most illustrious," if he could do nothing better for
him.</p>

<p>Rodolph, however, whose only object was, if
possible, to keep them all quiet, would say nothing
further than, that in a matter of so great importance,
more mature consideration and longer thought was
necessary.</p>

<p>Any attempt to unravel and detail all the intrigues,
negotiations, schemes, and machinations, to which this
question of precedency gave rise, would almost involve
writing the official and court history of Italy for nearly
half a century. The election of popes was struggled
for, cardinals were created, royal marriages made and
plotted, alliances and hostilities entered upon, all with
a view to this matter. And treaties between one state and
another chiefly turned on the condition that one party
should admit the "serenity" of the other. Surely "low
ambition and the pride of kings," never stooped to
busy themselves about "meaner things" than these silly
and ridiculously vain–glorious puerilities. It is curious
to mark, how the means adopted by the despots of Italy
to enervate and degrade their people, acted equally on
themselves; and ensured, that the ruler of a nation
of fribbles and slaves, should be an eminent "representative
man" of their own order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DAUGHTER OF ST. MARK.</div>

<p>It is amusing to find, that Bianca had no sooner
entered the magic circle of the sacred brotherhood of
sovereigns, than she too, as though she had been "to
the manner born," shaped herself to the ways and
thoughts of her new peers, and must needs have her
troubles and negotiations about her rank and style and
dignity! If emperors could smile at the ridicule of
sovereign dukes, surely the commentary thus supplied
on Francesco's pathetic complaint, that even the devils
in hell have their proper rank and title, must have
relaxed the grim Hapsburg features a little! The
case was this:—Don Cesare d'Este, it was reported,
was to marry the daughter of the Doge Niccolò da
Ponte; one of the conditions of the contract being
that the bride was to be crowned daughter of the
Republic! Where was the use of giving Francesco
the title of "most serene," if every other was to be
as serene as he? And where was the compliment of
making Bianca a daughter of St. Mark, if the saint
was going to have a whole family of daughters?
Bianca sent an envoy to Venice to remonstrate, and
insist on her claim to be not only the daughter, but
the only daughter of St. Mark.</p>

<p>When Bianca's remonstrance was read by her envoy
in the Senate, those grave and reverend Seniors,
Galluzzi<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> tells us, burst into uncontrollable laughter.
Reflecting, however, that the step taken must be considered
as a complaint of the sovereign of Tuscany
against their state, and that therefore some serious
answer must be given to it, they passed a censure on
the secretary who had read this precious document, for
venturing to bring any such matter before them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
declared that they knew nothing of any such proposed
marriage, and reminded Bianca, that her quality of
daughter of St. Mark did not confer upon her any
right whatsoever to interfere with the deliberations of
the Republic. The grand–ducal envoy strove to make
the best of the matter for his employers, by protesting
that his mistress's jealousy on the subject arose solely
from the very high value she set on that honour, and
should be taken to indicate only the intensity of her
affection and respect for the Republic. But the Senate
could not be restored to good humour. The consciousness,
perhaps, that a ridicule had been cast, even by
the laughter into which they had been surprised
themselves, on the daughtership of the Republic, helped
to make them feel angry; and the envoy was curtly
answered, that his application was ill–considered,
untimely, and calculated to lead to unpleasant consequences.
With which almost menacing answer
Bianca's messenger had to return to her.</p>

<p>On the 29th of March, in this same year, 1582, poor
Giovanna's son Filippo died in his fifth year. It was a
severe blow to the Grand Duke. But as, according to
the etiquette of the Spanish court, Philip II. had
neither manifested nor permitted to be manifested any
sign of grief when <i>his</i> first–born son died, Francesco
thought that he would show his royal breeding by
imitating so bright an example. Bitter as the loss
was to him, therefore, he would not suffer a sigh to
escape him, and forbade all mourning whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
But the Tuscans, who had too recently been made
acquainted with a sovereign to have learnt the ways
and habits of the race, misunderstood their Duke's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
high–breeding; and thinking simply that Francesco
was not sorry for the infant's death, proceeded to conclude,
according to a course of things which <i>was</i>
familiar and intelligible to them, that Bianca had poisoned
the child.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MOODY MATE.</div>

<p>There is, however, not the slightest reason to suspect
that anything of the kind was the case. And it may even
be doubted whether the death was welcome to Bianca.
It is true, that any hope she may have conceived of
being able to secure the succession for Don Antonio,—and
she seems at times to have formed schemes of the
kind,—was rendered possible only by this event.
Barring any offspring which might afterwards be born
either to Ferdinando or Pietro, Antonio was now the
only (reputed) descendant of the house. But, on the
other hand, the death of his son threw the Grand
Duke into a deeper gloom of melancholy and discontent
than ever. And Francesco was not an easy man
to live with under such circumstances.</p>

<p>His repining often took the form of reproaches to
Bianca for her childlessness. And, assuredly, never
were reproaches less deserved, if an earnest desire for
offspring, that would continue hoping against hope,
were any title to escape from them. Not a nostrum–monger
was to be heard of on either side of the Alps,
that the unhappy woman did not summon to her aid.
With untiring perseverance and ever renascent credulity,
she essayed their prescriptions, whether mystical
or physical, with the result, it would seem, of very
seriously impairing her constitution. More than once
she deceived her husband, and very possibly was deceived
herself, by false announcements of her pregnancy.
If, as it is stated,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> she made Francesco believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
that she had suffered once or more from miscarriage
during these years, she was of course guilty of deceit,
however much she may have been imposed upon by
the impostors who surrounded her. And the only
intelligible motive of such falsehood would seem to
have been the notion, that by thus keeping alive her
husband's hope of having an heir by her, the danger
that he might perhaps seek to break his marriage with
her, in order to unite himself with some more fortunately
circumstanced wife, might be avoided.</p>

<p>The principal residence of the unhappy couple at
this period was the solitary villa of Pratolino. The
name will be familiar to most travellers in Italy; for
the pretty park on the slope of the Apennine, with its
magnificent view of the vale of Arno and distant
Florence far beneath it, has become a favourite haunt
of Florentine pic–nic parties. And the bright green
glades, cool mountain air, and fine old trees, make the
scenery more like that of English pleasure grounds
than perhaps any other spot in Italy.</p>

<p>But the dwelling in which the moody Duke hid
himself and his wife from the hate–envenomed eyes of
his subjects, exists no longer. Of the pleasure villa, the
title of which, like that of many another pleasure scheme,
turned out to be so mocking a satire on the designer
of stone and mortar happiness, not one block remains
upon another. It was situated about eight miles from
Florence, in the direction of Bologna, a distance
sufficient to secure to Francesco perfect retirement,
and that total neglect of all state business and cares
in which he indulged during the latter years of his
reign. The contemporary accounts<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> which have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
down to us of the manner of life he led, shut up in
his solitary villa with the unhappy Bianca, are so
strange, as to warrant us in concluding that some
touch of insanity must have mingled in the disastrously
combined elements of his mental and physical
constitution. The extraordinary excesses recorded as
having been habitual to him are more like the freaks
of a madman than the indulgences of a voluptuary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUCAL HABITS.</div>

<p>We hear of his abuse of distilled waters and elixirs;
his "immoderate and pernicious familiarity<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> with oil
of vitriol, and too frequent use of distilled cinnamon
water." His food was always compounded with "hot
spices, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and pepper." He would
take before eating, during his meal, and after it, a
quantity of raw eggs, filled with the hot red pepper of
Spain. He was fond of the most indigestible kinds of
food, and would eat to excess of raw garlic and capsicums,
raw onions, radishes, leeks, and roots of various
sorts, with enormous quantities of the strongest cheese.
His wine was always of the most fiery and heady sorts.
And when he had heated himself beyond endurance
with inordinate quantities of such burning liquors and
spices, and loaded his stomach with such crudities, he
would drink large quantities of iced water, plunge his
head and hands in snow, and go to bed in iced sheets.
This latter practice was his constant habit; and the
writer of the letter cited above says that he did so in
imitation of Prospero Colonna and other men of note
of that time,—a not improbable trait in the character
of a man who refused to mourn his child's death in
imitation of another great man.</p>

<p>The characteristic manifestations of his mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
condition the while, were, if unhappily less extraordinary,
yet quite as unhealthy as his bodily habits.
A dark heavy melancholy, ever and anon blazing out
in fits of savage ferocity, seemed to grow upon him
from day to day. And, upon the whole, he must at
this period have been as dangerous and intolerable an
animal to live with as can well be imagined.</p>

<p>And if now, once again, we suppose Bianca to cast
up her accounts and "take stock" of her position, shut
up in this lonely Apennine villa, with a half–mad savage
for her mate, conscious of having earned the bitterest
hatred and execrations of an entire people, and tormented
with unceasing repining for the one unattainable
blessing, which should have realised, or seemed to
realise, some gain out of so much sin and suffering,—perhaps
she may have begun to have misgivings as to
the measure and value of her "success."</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">The family feeling in Italy.—Who shall be the heir?—Bianca at
Cerreto.—Camilla de' Martelli.—Don Pietro on the watch.—Bianca
at her tricks again.—The Cardinal comes to look after matters.—Was
Francesco dupe or accomplice?—Bianca's comedy becomes a
very broad farce.—A "Villegiatura" at Poggio–a–Cajano.—The
Cardinal wins the game.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The death of the child Filippo was a not less
important event to the Cardinal Ferdinando, than to
Bianca and Francesco. Ferdinando would have been
well content to see the succession of his family pass in
due course to a legitimate heir of his elder brother,
born of a mother of princely rank. Possibly he might
even have been contented if there could have been a
legitimately born heir by Bianca. His ambition was
wholly for the family, the clan, the race whose name he
bore. The excess of this vice, or virtue, is very
remarkably characteristic of the Italian idiosyncrasy.
It marks every page of the entire course of Italian
history, and indeed may be said to constitute a large
portion of it. Ferdinando lived for the advancement of
the Medicean fortunes and greatness. His feelings and
his crimes were prompted by this his master passion;
and his virtues, such as they were, of decorousness,
moderation, and long–suffering forbearance under his
brother's provocations, were practised for the same
sake.</p>

<p>Bianca manifested, as we have seen, a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
tendency. The first fruits of the great rise in the
world, which made her a prince's "cosa," were dedicated
to promote the greatness of the Cappello family. The
large sums, grasped in Florence, as the price of degradation,
fraud and venality, were despatched to the still
dear Venice, which had outlawed her, and to the father,
who had first neglected her and then put a price upon
her husband's head, not assuredly from tender filial
affection, but that a new Cappello palace might be purchased,
and the Cappello name be made great in Venice.</p>

<p>This constantly recurring feeling, which at bottom is
but the expression of an intensified individuality, will
be found to lie at the root of Italian national disaster;
and to be an operating cause, to a greater degree
probably than any other circumstance, of the secular
impossibility—or extreme difficulty, let us more hopefully
say—of constructing a nation out of the materials
bequeathed by the Italian middle ages to modern times.
The intense and exclusive devotion to family in the
men who have ancestors, and the same feeling
translated into devotion equally intense and exclusive
to a municipality, in the men who have none, act as a
mutually repellent force on the constituent parts of
society, are a dissolvent instead of a uniting and constructive
influence, and are deadly to all national
patriotism.</p>

<p>Ferdinando then asked only, that the name and
greatness of his family should be perpetuated by a
regular duly born heir to his eldest brother. And the
death of the little Filippo was to him a misfortune of
the most fatal kind. For now again the danger that
the wretched purchased base–born brat they called
Antonio, might become the successor to all the honours,
wealth, and greatness of the extinct Medici, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
imminent. And the idea was utterly intolerable.
Rather than that ... anything, that might be
necessary to prevent it!</p>

<div class="sidenote">DON ANTONIO.</div>

<p>The conduct of Francesco with reference to Don
Antonio after Filippo's death was such as to justify in
the strongest manner the Cardinal's misgivings and
suspicions respecting his brother's, and more especially
Bianca's intentions concerning him. The estates
settled on him were increased to the value of sixty
thousand scudi a year. A magnificent villa, and grand
palace in the city were prepared for his use. Worse
still, Francesco had obtained from the king of Spain
that the estates purchased for this fortunate youth in
the kingdom of Naples should be erected into a
principality. And Don Antonio accordingly, now took
the style and title of a Prince, and assumed palpably
the next place after the sovereign in the eyes of the
Florentines.</p>

<p>These circumstances induced the Cardinal in the
course of the year 1585, to think seriously of obtaining
a dispensation, to enable him to quit the priesthood,
give up his cardinal's hat, and marry. Before taking
this extreme step however, he determined on endeavouring,
if possible, to persuade his brother, Don
Pietro, to marry. This was very difficult to do. For
though Pietro hated his eldest brother and Bianca
quite well enough to be ready to do his best to
counteract their plans, he cared nothing for the family
name or greatness; and the extreme profligacy of his
life made marriage extremely distasteful to him. He
alleged in reply to the Cardinal's instances, that the
vow he had made to the Virgin, on the occasion of
murdering his wife, stood in the way. He had solemnly
promised not to marry again, and could not charge his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
conscience with the breach of so solemn a vow. He
added, to save trouble, that no theologian would
succeed in persuading him,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> that the engagement so
undertaken was not valid. Nevertheless, he at last
consented to do as the Cardinal would have him; and
accordingly set on foot negotiations for obtaining the
hand of a lady of the Spanish court. Having done
this much however, he seemed to be in no hurry to
conclude the matter, and continued his usual dissolute
life in Florence.</p>

<p>At length, about the middle of November, 1585, he so
far yielded to the urgent representations of the Cardinal,
as to announce his intention of starting for Spain, to
conclude in person the arrangements for his marriage.
But about a month later, while he was still waiting for
the passage of the Spanish galleons, the news was
suddenly spread over Tuscany, that the Grand Duchess
had had a miscarriage while staying at Cerreto.
Cerreto was a remote villa belonging to the Grand
Duke, in the hills, near Empoli, in the lower Valdarno.
Some writers assert, that it was in this lonely old castle,
and not at Poggio Imperiale, that Paolo Giordano Orsini
murdered Isabella. At all events, the place was well
adapted for the perpetration of such a deed; and it
would seem to have no recommendation save its remoteness,
which could have induced Bianca to select it as
the scene of her confinement.</p>

<p>This new attempt convinced both the younger
brothers of the absolute necessity of keeping the
strictest possible watch on Bianca and the Grand
Duke. It was pretty clear indeed, that the Grand
Duchess only awaited a good opportunity for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
repetition of the farce so successfully played at the
birth of Don Antonio. This time it had for some
reason failed. The mother of the child provided for
the contemplated fraud may have miscarried;—the
child may have died; or some other accident of the
kind have made it necessary that Bianca should terminate
her comedy thus ineffectually. But there was
every reason to fear that the attempt would be
repeated, and very possibly with better success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMILLA DE' MARTELLI.</div>

<p>Pietro therefore determined to defer his departure;
and the Cardinal, when he heard his reasons for doing
so, fully approved of his remaining in Florence, till
they could have an opportunity of consulting together
on the subject.</p>

<p>This was furnished them early in the following year,
1586, on the occasion of the marriage of Virginia de'
Medici, the daughter of Cosmo by his wife Camilla
de' Martelli, with Don Cesare d'Este. Virginia was thus
half–sister to Francesco, Ferdinando, and Pietro, and
the Cardinal was to come to Florence to be present at
the ceremony. The marriage was accompanied by
more than usual splendour. But the only circumstance
that excited<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> the interest of the Florentines in the
matter, was to see their old Grand Duchess, poor
Camilla Martelli, still very beautiful, appearing once
again among them, as if risen from the grave. Francesco
had permitted her to come out from her nunnery
prison, in which he had kept her now twelve years, to
be present at the marriage of her daughter. And all
Florence was disgusted and astonished, as far as any
fresh atrocity on the part of Francesco could astonish
it, when the unhappy lady was, at the conclusion of the
ceremony, compelled to return to her cell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<p>Ferdinando, who had frequently endeavoured in vain
to induce his brother to mitigate the rigour of her
imprisonment, was much angered by this new cruelty.
His disgust was increased by the Duke's curt refusal to
lend him any money; and he returned to Rome with
feelings as hostile to his brother as they had ever been;
but not before he had arranged with Don Pietro that he
should remain in Florence to watch the proceedings of
Bianca and the Grand Duke. The Cerreto event was
rendered much more important in their eyes, by the
circumstance of the Duke's having, by a formal circular,
announced the pregnancy of the Grand Duchess and
its unfortunate termination to all the friends and
connections of the family. Of what use was it, they
asked, to publish the news of a misfortune of such a
nature? Evidently it was intended only to keep alive
in the minds of those addressed, the expectation that
Bianca might have another confinement, and thus
prepare the way for a new fraud.</p>

<p>To guard against this was, as the Cardinal felt,
paramount to all other considerations. Anxious, therefore,
as he had been that Don Pietro should proceed to
Spain, to conclude the arrangements for his own
marriage, he judged it yet more important that he
should for the present remain at Florence.</p>

<p>And it was not long before the suspicions, which had
dictated this surveillance, were justified by the event.</p>

<p>In the April of 1586, reports began to be spread that
the Grand Duchess was again pregnant. And on the
15th of that month Don Pietro wrote to the Cardinal as
follows:—<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PIETRO'S LETTER.</div>

<p>"I learned from a sure source that Pellegrina"—Bianca's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
daughter by Bonaventuri, born, as the reader
may remember, shortly after her arrival in Florence,—"was
with child; and that the fact was kept secret
with the greatest care. Some excuse has been found
for sending abroad the Count Ulisse,"—Pellegrina's
husband, Ulisse Bentivoglio,—"in order that his wife
might naturally, and without giving any cause for
suspicion, be brought to stay in the palace during his
absence. And I have already found out, that in the rooms
which it is intended to assign to her, there are no end of
hiding–places, and secret stairs communicating with the
chamber of the Grand Duchess. All which leaves very
little doubt as to this woman's intention. Now, having
had ground to fear that some knowledge of Pellegrina's
being with child had got abroad, they have told the
public that she has miscarried. And this circumstance
leads me to feel the more sure of the game she is bent
on. And it strikes me, that they have so favourable a
combination of person, place, and good–will for the
accomplishment of their end, that my presence here can
do little to prevent it. For, as to the place, the numerous
means of ingress and egress, render it the most
adapted for their purpose that could be imagined. As
for the person, having Pellegrina with child, ready there
to their hand, they may accomplish their object at any
moment that is most convenient. And as for good will,
there can be no doubt that the Grand Duke would far
rather be succeeded on the throne by the grandchild of
his wife, than by one in whom he has no interest. It
is for your Eminence to judge whether under these
circumstances my presence here can be of any use; and
whether indeed it may not be more harmful than otherwise;
seeing that they will assuredly bring their scheme
to bear; and if I am compelled to be here and to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
on in silence, the world will consider that a ground for
believing the pregnancy of the Grand Duchess to be
genuine."</p>

<p>The fact was that the Grand Duke and the Grand
Duchess did everything they could think of to make
remaining at Florence intolerable to Don Pietro. The
courtiers were encouraged to treat him in every possible
way with disrespect and insolence. A Spanish mistress,
who was living with him at Florence, was continually
insulted by Bianca. The Grand Duke's own manner
was so brutal to him, that Pietro avoided ever being
seen by him. All this torment kept Pietro, who was a
passionate man, and unused to the Cardinal's habits of
self–command and dissimulation, in such a state of
irritation, that he was anxious only to escape from
Florence. "I remain here," he wrote to the Cardinal,
"with such loathing, that any other place however
wretched would be a Paradise to me in comparison."
And he told him how his suspicions were confirmed,
and at the same time his presence rendered of small
avail, by the placing of new sentinels in various parts
of the palace, the erection of gates on the staircases,
and the total inaccessibility of the Grand Duke and
Grand Duchess.</p>

<p>The Cardinal still urged him to arm himself with
patience, and remain at his post, till they should have
an opportunity of consulting together upon the subject
in person. "The pregnancy of Pellegrina," he wrote,
"gives me less suspicion than that of any other woman.
For her lying–in would be necessarily attended with so
many circumstances of publicity, with regard to time,
place, number, and quality of assistants, &amp;c., that it
would seem impossible to turn it to account for the
purpose in question. Nevertheless, it is well to keep a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
watchful eye upon her; but not with such exclusive
attention as to prevent you from looking elsewhere.
For those who are bent on similar frauds have need
rather of the aid of the lowest classes of society,
whose children come into the world at street corners."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIETRO AND BIANCA.</div>

<p>At last, however, Don Pietro's letters urging the
Cardinal to consent to his leaving Florence became so
pressing, concluding as they did with a hint, that if he
were kept there any longer, "something might happen
which his Eminence might be very sorry for, when it
was too late to help it," that Ferdinando thought it
best to agree to his going to Spain. It was determined,
however, that before his departure he should find some
means of letting the Grand Duke and Duchess know
that they were watched, and thus warning them, that
any attempt to tamper with the succession of the Duchy
would not pass unobserved or undisputed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when it happened that Bianca, who was
extremely anxious to get rid of her brother–in–law, sent
him notice that the Spanish galleons were at Leghorn,
and that, if he wished for a passage, it behoved him to
start, he took the opportunity of waiting upon her;
and in reply to her intimation, said that he should
consider himself failing in the duty he owed her
Highness if he were not to wait until her confinement
were over, especially as the Cardinal had made a great
point of his paying her that attention. Bianca replied
that she really did not think for her part that she was
with child; that the Grand Duke indeed had got it into
his head that she was so, and could not be persuaded
otherwise; that it was true enough that she was far
from well; but that, if she really were with child, she
was certainly only in the third month; and that whatever
the event might be, she would take care that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and the Cardinal should be made acquainted with it
instantly.</p>

<p>In the letter, in which Pietro gives the Cardinal an
account of this interview,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> he writes: "I watched most
closely her manner and the changes of her countenance,
which were exceedingly visible. She changed colour in
the most violent manner. It seems to me that I have
done my part of the business, and have left such a fly
in her ear, that she will either find herself forced to
declare herself shortly, or that she will have the greatest
difficulty in bringing her scheme to a good issue."</p>

<p>It was not long before the Cardinal came himself to
Florence, to see how matters were going on, much to
the annoyance of the Grand Duke. He brought with
him his cousin, Don Luigi di Toledo; and, by his
means, took care to pour into Francesco's ear all the
sinister rumours which were, he said, afloat respecting
Bianca's pregnancy. He made Don Luigi tell him, as
from himself, that unpleasant things had been said at
the court of Spain; and pointed out to him, that,
under these circumstances, his honour absolutely required
that the birth of a prince, if, indeed, one was
about to be born, should be so managed as to remove
all possibility of suspicion and slander.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke became more and more irritated
from day to day, as these rumours and observations
were forced upon him. He grew restless and agitated;
and conceived a more bitter hatred than ever against
Ferdinando, who was, as he believed, with a near
approach to truth, the principal, if not the only mover
of it all. But it is remarkable, as Galluzzi observes,
that the more the Grand Duke became savage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
brutal in his manner to the Cardinal, the more profuse
was Bianca in graciousness and affability, and in the
apparent openness with which she spoke to him of her
hopes or fears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REPORTS IN FLORENCE.</div>

<p>Leaving matters in this train, the Cardinal returned
to Rome; while, according to Florentine court authorities,
Bianca's pregnancy continued to proceed towards
its conclusion in the most satisfactory manner. The
Grand Duke's conduct during this time makes it very
difficult to judge whether he sincerely believed that
the Grand Duchess was about to give him an heir at
last, or whether he was all the time contemplating a
second performance of the farce which took place at the
birth of Don Antonio, of which he had been at first the
dupe, but in which he had become afterwards the accomplice;—or,
finally, whether both these suppositions
were true, so that, if his sincere hopes of a child by
Bianca should be disappointed, he was ready to supply
the desideratum by a fraud. He lived in a perpetual
agitation of mind, and showed a degree of irritation
and annoyance at the notice which the Cardinal's
manœuvres had drawn upon the doings at the Pitti,
that, joined to his former conduct, is suspicious. On
the other hand, he acted in many respects as if he were
sincere in the matter.</p>

<p>It is also to be observed that, possibly enough,
Bianca may have been sincere on this occasion; especially
as we know she never abandoned her hopes, and
was always trying new means to bring about her desire.
She seems to have professed to be very doubtful on
the subject to the last. But some writers insinuate,
that while she expressed doubts to the Cardinal, she
spoke in an entirely different manner to her husband.</p>

<p>Meantime, the daily reports in Florence were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
amusement of the citizens, and the bulletins made
Francesco and his hopes the laughing–stock of all
Italy.</p>

<p>Francesco had ordered that all the chiefs of the
different magistracies, the Archbishop of Florence, and
the Bishop Abbioso, should be present at the birth.
And this, it must be owned, looks very much as if he
were sincere in his expectations, either duped by
Bianca, as in the former case, or partaking in her
error. He also wrote to the Cardinal, though in very
ungracious terms, to invite his presence at Florence
on the occasion. "Since the promotion (of Cardinals)
is over," he wrote, "and there is nothing further to
detain your Eminence in Rome, I will not neglect to
tell you that the Grand Duchess advances in her pregnancy
visibly from day to day, and with greater hope
of a fortunate issue than ever. You can therefore
come, if it so please you, and observe all that takes
place. You have still the time to do so, and cannot
now say afterwards, that you were left in ignorance
upon the subject."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>But in answer to this hostilely worded invitation,
and to a second letter written in the same tone, the
Cardinal replied by an angry letter, absolutely refusing
to come or to send any one to Florence on his behalf,
"as he had no wish to see or hear more in the matter
than the Grand Duke did himself, seeing that his
Highness was the person chiefly interested."</p>

<p>That this was false we know with certainty from the
Cardinal's correspondence with his brother, Don Pietro.
He had been extremely anxious to obtain a better
guarantee for the truth respecting the issue of Bianca's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
pregnancy than the Grand Duke's testimony. What
then was the cause of this sudden change of tone?
Are we to suppose that he had already taken his
measures for being informed of the truth so satisfactorily
as to feel that his own presence in Florence could
be of no further use? Or had he convinced himself
that no fraud was on this occasion intended?</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOPE TELLS A FLATTERING TALE.</div>

<p>And thus matters went on till December, in the year
1586, the time when, according to Bianca's calculations,
her confinement ought to be near at hand. And
all was still doubt and suspense. The four court
physicians held different opinions on the great question.
The highest obstetric authorities, summoned
from all parts of Italy, were equally far from being
unanimous. The courtiers, however, daily perceived
increasing signs of the approach of the wished–for
event. The Bishop Abbioso certified to having felt
the movement of the expected stranger. His rivals
in court favour strove to better his bidding for the
sovereign's good graces by boldly predicting twins.
Francesco kept horses ready saddled, and couriers
booted, to carry the glad tidings in different directions
the instant his hopes should be fulfilled. And all the
Florence gossips the while were amusing themselves
at the expense of the much hated prince, and the still
more detested "witch," his wife, by unceasing volleys
of satires, pasquinades, and unseemly jests. Till one
fine morning the horses were unsaddled, the couriers
permitted to retire, and the Florentines were informed
that, after a fit of colic which had been so severe as to
endanger her life, the person of the Grand Duchess
had resumed its usual form.</p>

<p>It is impossible to arrive at any certainty of the
truth respecting this incident of Bianca's career.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Bearing in mind, however, her previous performances,
and the very potent reasons she had to find in some
way an heir for the duchy,—remembering also Francesco's
evident annoyance at the attention drawn to
the matter by his brothers, and the arrangements made
at the palace, the probability seems to be, that it was
intended to introduce a supposititious child, as on the
former occasion; that the vigilance and dexterity of
the Cardinal compelled the sovereign conspirators to
abandon the scheme as too dangerous; and that all
Francesco's measures for security, publicity, and
authenticating the birth, were merely blinds, under
cover of which the tentative might be abandoned.</p>

<p>Soon after this event the Grand Duke and the
Cardinal became once more apparently reconciled by
the good offices of the Archbishop of Florence. Correspondence
was resumed on a friendly footing; and now
that there was no further question of the Grand Duke's
having an heir, the two brothers could act together in
schemes for the marriage of Don Pietro, who was all this
time at the court of Spain, getting deeper every day into
debt and into infamy by the outrageous profligacy of
his conduct, and pretending to be taking steps, but in
reality doing nothing, towards making some suitable
marriage. Bianca, also, was, as she had never ceased
to be since her marriage, all amiability and affability
towards Ferdinando; and it was agreed that he should
come to Florence, to visit his brother and sister–in–law,
at the time of the "villeggiatura," the following
September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VILLEGGIATURA.</div>

<p>This "villeggiatura,"—the autumnal country–life portion
of a town–loving Italian's year, when landed proprietors
leave the city "palazzo," which is their family
seat and residence, to spend a month, or perhaps two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
at their villa, and among their vineyards, and invite
their friends to pass the "villeggiatura" with them, as
an Englishman fills his house at Christmas,—this
villeggiatura to which Ferdinando was invited by
Francesco and Bianca, was to take place at Poggio–a–Cajano,
one of the Grand Duke's numerous country
residences. Notwithstanding its name—"Poggio,"—a
hill, it is a low–lying spot on the banks of the
Ombrone, at the foot of Monte Albano, about half way
between Florence and Pistoia. The pleasure–grounds
around the house are intersected by a great number of
canals, many of which can hardly be correctly called
streams, and altogether there is a great deal of water,
more or less approaching to a stagnant condition in the
immediate neighbourhood. It is, in short, a place which
would be at once pronounced as very ineligible for
an autumnal residence under an Italian sun, by any
one possessed of the smallest smattering of sanitary
science.</p>

<p>The Cardinal did not arrive in Florence till the
beginning of October. He was received with all demonstrations
of the most affectionate welcome; and
the party proceeded at once, as had been planned, to
Poggio–a–Cajano. The Archbishop of Florence, who
had on more than one occasion acted as a mediator
between the two brothers, accompanied them. The
days, we read, were passed in sport among the surrounding
hills and marshes, which abounded in game;
and the evenings in conversations, in which the Archbishop
and Bianca, who strove, apparently, in every
way to render herself agreeable to her guest, did all
they could to conciliate and soothe the two evil,
though so different, natures of those brothers Medici.</p>

<p>The days that thus passed, however, could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
been but very few. And the remainder of the strange
story, if restricted to such facts as are certain, and
universally admitted, may be told with a brevity that
will not appear more abrupt to the reader, than were
the events sudden and startling to those who witnessed
them.</p>

<p>On the 19th of October, about nine o'clock in the
evening, the Grand Duke Francesco died. And on the
following morning—(writers differ about the hour)—Bianca
followed him.</p>

<p>Ferdinando succeeded without disturbance to the
throne. Francesco was interred, by his orders, with
all due pomp in the family mausoleum, under the
dome of San Lorenzo; and Bianca was, also by his
orders, thrown, wrapped in a sheet, into the common
receptacle for the bodies of the poor, under the nave of
that church.</p>

<p>These are the entire ascertainable facts of the case.
But it will be interesting to examine the different
opinions which have prevailed respecting them among
Florentine historians; and, after weighing their conjectures,
to judge for ourselves as to the balance of
probabilities for or against them.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">Three hypotheses respecting the deaths of Francesco and Bianca—The
official version of the story—The novelist's version of the story—A
third possibility—Circumstances that followed the two deaths—Bianca's
grave; and epitaphs for it by the Florentines—Ferdinand's
final success.</p>

<p class="pn p2">As the record of all that can claim to be undoubted
fact in the history of these strange events is startlingly
brief, so would an account of all the suppositions, speculations,
and conjectures, to which they have given
rise, in perpetually succeeding crops from that time to
this, be interminably long. Historians, apologists,
antiquarians, archive–diggers, dramatists, novelists,
have discussed and re–discussed the matter, settled it
in different ways, according to their partialities or dispositions,
and made up their minds to one or the other
theory. But the only real result of their labours is
the certainty, that the matter must rest in total uncertainty
ever more, and that each reader must estimate
for himself the probabilities of the case according to
his own views and theories of human character, and its
springs of action.</p>

<p>The different opinions that have been held respecting
these mysterious deaths, may be reduced to the following
three distinct hypotheses.</p>

<p>First. The Grand Duke died of a tertian fever,
caught by exposing himself to great fatigue under the
autumnal sun, and rendered fatal by his refusal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
submit to proper medical treatment, and his adoption
in its place of a most preposterous system of ice–cold
drinks and other applications, all acting on a constitution
already ruined by previous excesses. Bianca
died of a similar complaint, rendered fatal in her case
also by the permanent mischief her system had suffered
from all the tricks she had played upon it.</p>

<p>Second hypothesis. Bianca, who was in the habit
of preparing, with her own hands, a certain tart or
pastry of which the Grand Duke was fond, introduced
poison into this dish, and, at supper, presented it to
the Cardinal. The Cardinal declined to eat of it, being
warned of the danger, add some, by the changing colour
of the stone in a ring he wore for this purpose. But
while the attention of Bianca was occupied with the
Cardinal, the Grand Duke helped himself to some of
his favourite dish, and before his wife could interfere
to prevent him, had eaten a sufficient quantity to prove
fatal. Bianca, seeing and comprehending at a glance
all the consequences of this fatal blunder, proceeded
to eat also of the poisoned food, thus at once creating
a strong presumption against her own guilt, and avoiding
all the evils, which she knew but too well would overwhelm
her, if she survived her husband, by sharing his
fate.</p>

<p>Third hypothesis. Francesco and Bianca both died
by poison. But the poisoner was the Cardinal; who,
while his victims were dying, prevented all access to
them, and who was the person chiefly and beneficially
interested in their death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HISTORIAN GALLUZZI.</div>

<p>The first version is of course that of the accredited
and official historians.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Galluzzi, in mentioning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
second supposition as that which had been popularly
believed, says, that it was so only by those who were
ignorant of the real facts of the case. But Galluzzi wrote
his history by commission of the Grand Duke Peter
Leopold, having been selected for the purpose, in consequence
of the too great freedom, and too indiscreet disclosures
of the history written by Martinetti,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and never
published: because the Grand Duke being displeased
with it on the above account, withdrew his patronage
from the author, and transferred it to Galluzzi. And in
histories written under these circumstances, sovereign
princes commit no murders; or, if that is, as in the
case of the Medici, unattainable by the most courtly
writer, at all events, as few as possible.</p>

<p>Galluzzi, however, prints the following letter, which,
<i>he says</i>, was written on the 16th of October to Rome.
He does not tell us who was the writer:</p>

<p>"The Grand Duke has had two tertian fevers, one
after the other; in fact, continual fever. He suffers
from extreme thirst. Nevertheless, thus far the
symptoms are favourable as regards ultimate recovery.
The fourth and seventh days have been favourable, with
a good perspiration; and we hope to go on improving.
But he must not commit any imprudence; and, its
being autumn, makes us fear that the recovery may be
tedious. Therefore, cause prayers to be put up; and
the more, because the Grand Duchess also has nearly
the same malady, which increases the Grand Duke's
sufferings, because she cannot attend him, and see to
nursing him."</p>

<p>If this is a genuine letter, written on the 16th,
it would be worth something towards deciding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
question in favour of the first hypothesis. But it seems
to be contradicted by a passage in that very curious
document, previously cited, which Guerrazzi has
printed at length in the notes to his "Isabella Orsini."
This author himself, assuredly not prejudiced in favour
of the Medici, speaking of this very important letter,
which he states to be previously inedited, and generally
unknown, and which is preserved in the Imperial
Library at Paris, under the No. 10, O 74, says,
"From this letter, evidently written by a person,
satirical rather than otherwise, and but little favourable
to the Medici, and especially to Francesco and to
Bianca Capello, we learn how false is the notion
that they were poisoned. The kind of life led by
them needed no aid to insure their speedy death, since
it is easy to perceive that they were in the habit of
poisoning themselves daily."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE'S DEATH.</div>

<p>I cannot, however, admit that the document in question
proves any such thing. It proves certainly that
its author, Giovanni Vettorio Soderini, writing apparently
very shortly after the events, professes to accept,
as it should seem, the statement officially put forth.
Yet even this is hardly clear from the very strange
manner and phraseology of the letter, which in its
opening sentences appears intended to convey some
meaning to the writer's correspondent, which is hidden
from us. It runs thus: "When in these last days
Death rode on his thin and ill–conditioned charger to
invest himself with the title of Great.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Death obtained
at Rome the title of Great, and having obtained this
most indecent title, he rode in haste towards Poggio–a–Cajano,
and there with irresistible force and equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
valour, assaulted the Great Tuscan of Florence and
Siena, and brought him down on the 19th of October,
1587, four and a half hours after sunset, and at forty–seven
years of age deprived him of life, after strange
and unusual writhings,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and much howling and groaning.
He remained speechless from after dinner till the
moment when he was seized with a most burning fever.
Signor Pandolfo de' Bardi and Signor Troiano Boba
have always asserted that he had caught a pleurisy from
too great and unwonted fatigue,"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> rendered fatal, the
writer goes on to say, by the strange and pernicious
habits of life indulged in by the Grand Duke, which
the letter proceeds to describe at great length.</p>

<p>Now here, in any case, the writer only repeats what
the two courtiers Pandolfo de' Bardi, and Troiano
Boba said, and does not pretend to any original knowledge
on the subject. But may it not be possible that
those strange opening sentences may be meant to
convey a meaning which the writer dared not express
clearly. If Ferdinando poisoned his brother, he rode
from Rome to Poggio–a–Cajano to invest himself with
the title of Great. If poison was prepared, or other
arrangements for carrying out the crime were made at
Rome, then he may be said to have obtained at Rome
the title of Great, and it may be added that the title
was "a most indecent one."</p>

<p>But further, this account of the death seems to
contradict the statement of the letter published by
Galluzzi, and cited above. The expressions seem to
be incompatible with the supposition of an illness of
several days. Finally, the mention of "strange and
unusual contortions and much howling and groaning,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
seem to indicate that some other cause of death than
the natural result of a pleurisy was in the writer's
mind.</p>

<p>It is further stated, in support of the supposition,
that the death was natural, that the bodies were opened
and examined after death; that of Bianca in the
presence of her daughter and son–in–law. To this it
may be remarked in the first place, that the medical
science of the time was wholly incompetent to ascertain
the cause of death from a post–mortem examination,
as will be remarkably exemplified in the following
pages of the life of Elizabetta Sirani. In the next
place the examiners were the court physicians, in the
pay and in the power of the new sovereign. And as
to the presence of Pellegrina and Bentivoglio, the fact
that Ferdinando should have sought to draw an
evidence of his innocence of any foul practice from a
circumstance so utterly useless and inconclusive as
the presence of two persons wholly ignorant of anatomy
and the action of poisons on the body, is rather a
presumption against him than otherwise. He must
have known perfectly well that had Bianca died by any
poison whatever, Pellegrina and Bentivoglio could have
been none the wiser for seeing the body opened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"LA PESSIMA BIANCA."</div>

<p>In favour of either the second or third hypothesis
there is no direct evidence whatever. If Ferdinando
de' Medici had to be tried for the murder, he must
according to all the evidence we have, be most
undoubtedly acquitted. But nobody at the time seems
to have believed in the two deaths having happened
from natural causes. Then the popular hypothesis
was the second. Notwithstanding the certificates of
court physicians, the statements of the progress of the
malady, and the post–mortem examinations, people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
found it very difficult to believe that two such opportune
deaths should occur all but simultaneously by
natural causes, the assigned nature of which did not
admit of any question of contagion. If anybody was
so unlucky as to have conceived the idea, that this death
might have "come riding" to Poggio–a–Cajano from
Rome, of course he very carefully suppressed all utterance
of it. But it was universally believed that Bianca
was capable of any amount of treachery, craft, and
crime. The story of the poisoned pastry, and the
dramatic events it gave rise to, made exactly one of
those narratives, rich in varied emotions and in retributive
justice, which storytellers like to tell, and their
audience like to hear. And it was perfectly safe to
cast as much odium as any brain could imagine on the
hated Bianca. To do so indeed was to fall in with the
court humour, and to share the feelings of the new
sovereign, who would never speak of her, or permit her
to be spoken of as the late Grand Duchess, and who
never himself named her otherwise, than as "the
wretch Bianca,"—<i>la pessima Bianca</i>.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The second hypothesis therefore was the popular
one among those who could not accept the official
account of the matter as credible, and has continued
to be the received version with the numerous novelists
and dramatists who have made increment of the
tragedy.</p>

<p>In favour of the third, it has been already admitted
that no tittle of <i>direct</i> evidence can be produced. The
value of the guess hazarded at the meaning conveyed
in those enigmatical phrases at the commencement of
Signor Soderini's letter will be different to different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
minds. Signor Guerrazzi, the discoverer and first
editor of this extraordinary letter, has evidently not
been struck by the idea that any such sense could be
seen in the words. On the contrary, he considers the
letter as conclusive against the poisoning, either by the
Cardinal or by Bianca. But it may be stated on the
other hand, that the interpretation above suggested has
seemed probable to other Italians versed in the history
of the time, and practised in extracting their secrets
from the wrappages in which writers who lived under
the survey of unscrupulous despots were commonly
wont to conceal their meaning.</p>

<p>Further, in a subsequent part of this same letter,
which is of great length, occupying no less than nineteen
closely printed post octavo pages, there are statements
which seem hardly compatible with the supposition
that Francesco died of an illness, which gradually
reached its conclusion at the end of several days.</p>

<p>"He—the Grand Duke—made no will either before,
or at this time.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Only he signed an order for fifty
thousand crowns to be distributed among the court
servants. Father Maranto confessed him; and he tells
me, that the Grand Duke did not specify the number
of crowns to be distributed, but desired in general
terms, that the servants should be remunerated, and
that it grieved him that he could not live long enough
to do it himself. The confessor <i>was not in time</i> to
remind him, by asking if he wished to make any further
provision for his friends; for he shut his eyes, and
could neither move his tongue, nor shake his head."</p>

<p>Surely all these evidences of haste, and deficiency of
time for the arrangement of matters, which the dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
man professes his wish to have settled, if a few more
moments had been allowed him, are scarcely compatible
with the supposition of an illness of several days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROBABILITIES.</div>

<p>At a subsequent page of his letter, Signor Soderini
drops a few words respecting the new Grand Duke's
manner some hours after the death of Francesco, which
are not without their significance. He makes the
number of hours which elapsed between the two deaths
eleven only. Francesco's death at "four hours and a
half after sunset," would have taken place according to
our mode of keeping time between nine and ten.
And at three in the morning, says the letter, the
Cardinal left Bianca still living, "and at half–past
seven arrived at the Prato gate." (He was therefore
four hours and a half travelling twelve miles);—"where
meeting the first Captain of the Lancers, he
said doubtingly,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> with fear, and a trembling voice,—as
I suppose by reason of the suddenness of the change,—'Henceforward,
Captain, you must be as faithful to
me, as you have hitherto been to my brother.'"</p>

<p>Signor Soderini may attribute, since he deemed it
safest to do so, the new Duke's trepidation and fear–marked
manner to an innocent cause. But it can
hardly but be felt, that such a manner is a weight in
the scale against a man, when the probabilities of his
having come fresh from the perpetration of fratricide
are being balanced.</p>

<p>Then the question of motives must be taken into
consideration; and it must be seen at once that the
reasons Ferdinando had for wishing Bianca removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
were of the very strongest nature. For the last ten
years and more, she had been a constant thorn in his
side, the ever recurring difficulty in all his schemes
for aggrandising the family, the wreck of all his
strivings for the support of the decorum and respectability
of the Medicean name, and the ground of discord
and hatred between him and his brother. She had
made the Grand Duke the laughing–stock of Italy, and
odious as well as contemptible to his own subjects.
Her blood–stained practising had succeeded in foisting
one base–born plebeian of alien blood into the family.
She was continually attempting still worse frauds to
wrong him of his birthright; and though by the
exertion of extreme vigilance her schemes had been
hitherto foiled, what possible security, short of her
death, could be had against the success of future
attempts of the same sort. A De Medici, and a sixteenth
century Cardinal may well have persuaded
himself that he was justified under the circumstances,
in adopting the only possible means of providing against
such treason, pregnant with such results.</p>

<p>But his brother? Can it be shown that Ferdinando
had sufficient motive to wish his brother's death, as to
favour the probability that he was his murderer? It
can only be said, that there was old hate between them,
constantly stimulated and embittered by fresh provocations
of the most galling sort on the part of the
elder brother; hate, made more dangerous by the
necessity for carefully suppressing all manifestation of
it for long years of self–restraining dissimulation; that
from the manner in which Francesco had received the
proposals of a second marriage after the death of his
first wife, there was very little room to hope that
Bianca's death would be followed by any marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
which might put the prospects of the family on a satisfactory
footing; that to have taken off Bianca and left
her husband alive would have been an exceedingly
dangerous step, for <i>then</i> the inquiries, the suspicions,
the post–mortem examinations, and the investigations,
would, of course, have been of a very different sort, and,
under the circumstances, very difficult to deal with;
that, finally, last, though far from least, Ferdinando
was a De Medici.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER BURIAL.</div>

<p>That shrewd and sagacious old man, Pope Sixtus V.,
saw at once,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> on hearing of what had happened, that
suspicion of the double murder would fall on the
Cardinal; and it may perhaps be said, without much
chance of inaccuracy, that the balance of opinion
among those most qualified to judge, has, in modern
times, inclined in that direction.</p>

<p>But to return from the region of conjecture to that
of historical certainty, a few words will suffice to tell
all that remains of Bianca's story. As soon as the
breath had left her body, the Bishop Abbioso, who
had been left at Poggio–a–Cajano by Ferdinando, wrote
to him:</p>

<p>"This instant, at eight o'clock—'quindici ore'—her
Most Serene Highness the Grand Duchess passed to
another life. The present messenger is sent in haste
to receive the orders of your Highness as to the disposition
of her body."</p>

<p>Orders were sent back that the body should "<i>be
kept intact till the evening</i>," and then opened, as has
been said. The same night it was buried, "so that no
memorial of her should remain;" the new sovereign's
reply to the application for orders on this head being,
"We will have none of her among our dead!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>The hatred of the Florentines for both Francesco
and Bianca was intense. If anything, the latter was
yet more detested than her husband. In addition to all
the grounds of hatred common to both of them, she
was a foreigner, and "a witch," a practiser of black
art. And this accusation, more than aught else, made
the burden of the abuse that was heaped upon her.
Of course, it was not safe to say much of the deceased
sovereign. But satirists, libellers, pasquinade–writers,
and epigraph–mongers, had full licence to exercise
their wit at the expense of the "pessima Bianca."</p>

<p class="b1">Here are specimens of their expressions of the popular
estimate of her, which were current in the city
immediately after her death. They are taken from the
same letter of Signor Soderini, so often quoted:</p>

<p class="ppq25">"Qui giace in un avel pien di malie<br />
E pien di vizi la Bianca Cappella,<br />
Bagasica, strega, maliarda e fella,<br />
Che sempre favorì furfanti e spie."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">In English:</p>

<p class="ppq20">"Here in a grave, brimful of vices foul<br />
And evil sorceries, Bianca lies,<br />
A huzzy, witch, and mistress of fell spells;<br />
In life the dearest friend of rogues and spies."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Another runs as follows:</p>

<p class="ppq20">"In questa tomba, in questa oscura buca<br />
Ch'è fossa a quei che non hanno sepoltura,<br />
Opra d'incanti, e di malie fattura<br />
Giace la Bianca, moglie del Granduca."</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Which may stand, if the absence of the rhyme be
excused, in English thus:</p>

<p class="ppq20">"Within this tomb, this undistinguished hole,<br />
The grave of those who sepulture have none,<br />
That worker of black arts and evil charms,<br />
Bianca lies, the wife of our Grand Duke."</p>

<p class="pn p2">In the ninth century, the outlying Catholic world
to the north of the Alps was horrified by reports, that
a woman was occupying the chair of Peter, and the
office of Heaven's vicegerent. A fact so scandalous
and so extraordinary found ready credence among the
monks and prelates of Germany. The reports of pious
pilgrims who had returned from Rome, and testified
that Christ's church was governed by a woman, were
cited with every appearance of good faith and authenticity.
And the story of Pope Joan, thus generated,
rapidly acquired a worldwide acceptation, and was for
ages believed, both within and without the pale of the
Church, as a veritable historical fact. And a vast mass
of learned, satirical, controversial, scandalous, and antiquarian
letter–press has resulted from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE JOAN STORY.</div>

<p>But the huge fiction, which grew to be so large and
so strong as to require the united efforts of several
able literary men armed with many heavy volumes to
kill it, was, like so many another dangerous mistake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
a very small and innocent error at its birth. The
pious pilgrim <i>had</i> come back from Rome. He <i>had</i>
brought with him a whole budget of stories of the
scandalous corruptions and wickedness he had witnessed
in the metropolis of Christendom. He <i>had</i>
asserted, and probably frequently repeated, that a
female ruled the Church. He <i>had</i> asserted the astounding
fact, that a woman was now Pope of Rome. And
the scandalised reporter of the abominations he had
witnessed in that far distant southern land across the
mountains, spoke with all sincerity. He little dreamed
of letting loose a falsehood, which as soon as ever it
had escaped from "the enclosure of his teeth," as old
Homer says, forthwith began to race with unovertakeable
swiftness round the world, like the unbagged
demon of a mediæval goblin–story. He simply spoke
figuratively. And his simple–minded, untravelled,
wonder–loving auditor or auditors received his words
literally.</p>

<p>That was all! But with what a mass of infinitely
more deadly error has that same little difference between
the speaker and his hearers, filled the world!</p>

<p>The ninth century pilgrim merely intended to
convey to his hearers, in the strongest manner he
could, the fact that the Pontiff was so wholly influenced
and governed by a woman, that she held all
the power in her hands, and <i>might be said</i>, indeed, to
be Pope herself, rather than the weak puppet who was
her slave.</p>

<p>And if in the seventeenth century communications
between one part of the world and another had been
as rare and as difficult as in the ninth; if men had
been then as ignorant, as simple, and greedy of the
marvellous; if the press, which is to such error what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
a terrier is to a rat, had not been in existence, the
historians of Europe might have chronicled a second
she–pontiff, the "Pope Olympia," as having ascended
the papal throne in the year 1644. For assuredly no
John, Benedict, nor Boniface of the worst and darkest
age of the Church ever lived more scandalously under
petticoat government, or gave greater occasion to the
assertion, that a woman was the real Pope in his stead,
than did Giovanni Batista Pamfili, who was elected in
that year.</p>

<p>Pope Olympia was born in 1594, at Viterbo. A
daughter of the noble and ancient, but poor, family of
the Maidalchini, she was, as the daughters of impoverished
nobles generally were, destined for the Church
from her infancy, and educated in a convent. But as
this branch of the ecclesiastical profession could lead
to nothing, at the best, more exalted than the station
of a lady Abbess, Donna Olympia, who felt herself to
have a soul above bead–counting, intimated, with a
firmness and decision all her own, her intention of
marrying. And an alliance was accordingly formed for
her with a provincial gentleman, as noble and as poor
as herself. As Giovanni Batista Pamfili, afterwards
Pope by the name of Innocent X., was past eighty
when he died in 1655, and must accordingly have been
born in or before the year 1575; and as his brother,
Donna Olympia's husband, must have been an elder
brother, it follows that this poor noble, whom the
ambitious and shrewd lady chose to wed, rather than
accept the nullity of a cloister life, was more than
nineteen years her senior. Nor does it appear that he
had any requisite, either of station, function, or talent,
which might have seemed capable of affording assistance
to Olympia's views of rising in the world.</p>

seminary, had looked out on the Roman world with a
shrewd and observant eye, and knew well what she
was about. What had the poor country noble to
render him worthy of Olympia's hand and adapted
to her views? He had a brother. Men who marry
don't rise in the ecclesiastical states. And you can't
marry a Cardinal, nor even a Bishop. Yet to hook
yourself more or less indissolubly on to something
of this sort, is the only possible means by which
"excelsior" aspirations can be gratified in the world
of Rome.</p>

<p>Man, even when tonsured and gowned, was not made
to live alone. And although sacerdotal policy has with
marvellous success contrived to cut off its priests from
the great family of mankind, fence out their hearts
from all the most sanctifying and ennobling sympathies
of humanity, and make their interests, affections,
prejudices, ambitions, always distinct from, and often
hostile to those of their fellow–creatures;—though all
this has with fatal skill been accomplished by the
ordinance of celibacy; still in this, as in every other
case of battle with the laws of nature, the measure of
success accomplished does not attain to the reversal
of these laws; but is limited to causing them to operate
evilly instead of beneficially for mankind.</p>

<p>The priest–world of Rome accordingly, while deprived
of the legitimate and beneficial influence of
woman, has in most ages been more subjected than
other social systems to her abnormal and mischievous
power. And Donna Olympia was perfectly well
aware, that the needful hooking–on process above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
mentioned might be accomplished with sufficient solidity
for her purpose without any coupling gear of
Hymen's forging.</p>

<p>But, as injury, done to any wheel or spring of a
beautiful piece of mechanism, deranges the working
of the whole, fatally in proportion to the perfection of
the entire contrivance, so the celibacy law in its fight
against nature turns other portions of human passion
to evil issues, which otherwise and elsewhere work to
good. The sacred family tie, which in other communities
produces so much that is great and virtuous,
becomes the abomination of nepotism at Rome, and
affords the only other channel besides the one alluded
to above, by which the grandeurs and pomps and
wealth of sacerdotal success can be made available to
the weaker sex.</p>

<p>To command, therefore, both these avenues to the
temple of Fortuna Sacerdotalis—to hang on to the
gown by both these ties of connection—to contrive by
one step to obtain the means of action in both these
ways—this was the master–stroke, which the high–looking
Roman maiden accomplished by her marriage
with the poor and no longer young noble to whom she
gave her hand. The husband with his poverty–stricken
coronet was in himself altogether useless to his aspiring
wife's ambitious views. But of a brother–in–law
with the tonsure, something might be made. A priest,
noble, not without capacity, unburdened with scruples,
already employed in some subaltern affairs, of malleable
material—give her such an one for an ally, and
the papal court for an arena, and Donna Olympia felt,
that she could do the rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMAN HISTORIANS.</div>

<p>It is curious, and characteristic of Roman life and
literature, that we are unable to ascertain what manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
man, as to outward appearance, was this "onestissimo
vice–marito,"<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> to whom Olympia thus united herself.
Hatreds run high at Rome. And though material
daggers are not wanting there on occasion, the natural
instinct of gowned nature is to <i>speak</i> them. The
Church, as we know, abhors blood, and her sons wear
no swords. But bloodless calumny is a quiet, decorous
weapon, always at hand, perfectly compatible with
sacerdotal proprieties, and unsparingly used accordingly
to gratify partisan rancour, in a state of society
in which every man's hopes and fortunes depend on
party successes or failures. The historical value of
Roman contemporary writers, therefore, is often very
doubtful. And even in a matter so unimportant, so
matter–of–fact, and so easily ascertainable as to the
stature of a Pope, we are left in uncertainty by the
conflicting statements of his contemporaries. While
those, who profited by and therefore approved of the
election of Innocent X., represent him as a man of
tall stature and majestic port, dignified in bearing, and
of venerable aspect, the greater number who suffered
by, and hated him, assure us that he was short, deformed,
and hideously ugly in feature.</p>

<p>The discrepancy in testimony is more valuably instructive
than certain information on the subject in
dispute would have been.</p>

<p>No such doubt, however, obscures the fact, that his
career abundantly justified the wisdom of Donna
Olympia's speculation. Between them they accomplished
what certainly neither of them would have
been able to do asunder. The partnership was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
highly "successful" one. Acting with wise docility,
entirely by his able sister–in–law's advice, the rising
churchman soon became a man of note; was employed
in various affairs of state; charged with a diplomatic
mission to Spain (which though directed, as far as
letters could avail, by Olympia, yet led the diplomatist
to complain, that things did not go so well with him
without her at his side); and, finally, was made Cardinal
in 1629, when he was about fifty–four, and she
thirty–five years of age.</p>

<p>Olympia's foot had thus gained the first round of the
ladder, which might lead her to the consummation of
her highest hopes. But the climbing was arduous!
Now was the time to put forth all her ability, her
knowledge of the Roman world, and of priestly nature.</p>

<p>It was fifteen years from Pamfili's nomination to the
purple, to his election to the papacy. And these years
were to be spent, under his guardian angel's tutorship,
in carefully studied appearances and unsleeping
vigilance. His life was to be a continual canvassing,
without permitting the smallest appearance of overt
candidateship for the great prize to appear.</p>

<p>To be chosen the infallible head of Christ's church,
to hold the power of the keys, and be Heaven's vicegerent
on earth, he of all the Christians on it!—how
was he to cause such a choice to fall on him?—how
appear to be the best, the most devout, the wisest,
the most learned, or even the ablest man for the purpose?
Donna Olympia knew better than to suppose
that it was necessary or even desirable to appear anything
of all this. She knew that there would be
candidates in the conclave relying on none of such
good gifts, but solely on the backing of the great
powers of Europe. She knew that her candidate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
would not be looked to by either of these pope–making
monarchs. But she knew also, that their influence
might neutralise the power of each other, and that in
such a case some man, who was obnoxious to no party,
feared by none, and deemed a safe compromise by all,
might have a very promising chance of finding himself
elected, as many a Pope has been on the <i>pis–aller</i>
principle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELECTION OF INNOCENT X.</div>

<p>This was the game which the shrewd Olympia
played and won. When the great Barberini Pope,
Urban VIII., died, after a long papacy of twenty–one
years, neither of the great parties in Europe, as represented
by their friends and creatures among the
Cardinals, was strong enough to make its own Pope
in spite of the determined opposition of its opponent.
The Conclave was at a dead lock. And at last a
compromise was found in the election of Innocent X.,
then seventy, or all but seventy years old. The real
acting Pope, Olympia, was just fifty.</p>

<p>There were eleven years of harvest–time before her
for the gathering in of the crop, which she had spent
her life in assiduously preparing. The time might
easily have been less, and she could scarcely have
expected that it should be more; for the new Pope
was already an infirm man, and Olympia lost no time
in making her hay while the Roman sun shone.</p>

<p>Her husband had died some time previously, leaving
her one son, the Prince Camillo, who was forthwith
made a Cardinal. The step was a strange one, and
quite in discord with the ordinary traditions of Roman
family policy. For Camillo was the sole scion of
the Pamfili race, at least of the descendants of the
Pope's father; and, though the purple might lead to
more immediate personal distinction, the continuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
of the family name was cut off by this means, and the
usual master passion of an ambitious Italian noble
frustrated. The making Camillo a Cardinal, moreover,
seemed still more unaccountable, when the
personal qualities of the young man were considered.
For he was so wholly uneducated, and incapable, that
not even a Papal uncle could succeed in thrusting
greatness upon him. His nomination thus took from
him the capability of serving the family interests in
the only way in which he was available, by continuing
the race and the name; while it exposed him and his
uncle and mother to a host of mortifications arising
from his gross and even rustic incapacity. The total
incompetence and stupidity manifested by him, when it
was attempted to entrust to his hands any of the business
that usually fell to the lot of a Cardinal nephew,
was such as to cause constant trouble and humiliation
to Innocent, who, we read, rarely met him without
irritable chidings.</p>

<p>The motive of this ill–judged promotion is to be
found probably in the peculiar nature of Olympia's
ambition. Unlike other Italian ambitions, which
almost always concentrated themselves on the building
up or aggrandising a family name, that of Donna
Olympia seems to have been wholly personal; the
love of power, and still more strongly the love of
wealth, for the sake of her own individual enjoyment
of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE VATICAN.</div>

<p>Fifteen centuries of Papal government had habituated
mankind to see without surprise in Heaven's
vicar on earth an amount of dereliction of duty, and
an enormity of distance between profession and practice,
such as has never been recorded in history, or
exhibited to the world in any other department of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
affairs. Yet Europe was startled at the novelty of the
position assumed by Olympia immediately on Innocent's
elevation. When, according to Roman custom,
as soon as the election of the new Pope was known,
the populace rushed to his palace to make permitted
plunder of its contents, the lady Olympia received
them, and flung open the doors to them—having, as
we are told, first taken the precaution of removing all
that was of much value, in anticipation of the event.
She accompanied the new Pope to the Vatican, and
established herself there as its mistress! No step of
domestic government or foreign policy decided on, no
grace, favour, or promotion accorded, no punishment
inflicted, was the pontiff's own work. His invaluable
sister–in–law did all. He was absolutely a puppet in
her hands. The keys of St. Peter were strung to her
girdle; and the only function in which she probably
never interfered, was blessing the people!</p>

<p>The great object of her unceasing care and diplomacy
was, to keep at a distance from Innocent every
person and every influence which could either lessen
her own, or go shares in the profits to be extracted
from it. For this, after all, was the great
and ultimate scope of her exertions. To secure the
profits of the papacy in hard cash; this was the
problem. No appointment to office of any kind was
made, except in consideration of a proportionable sum
paid down into her own coffers. This often amounted
to three or four years revenue of the place to be
granted. Bishoprics and benefices were sold as fast
as they became vacant. One story is related of an
unlucky disciple of Simon, who, on treating with the
Popess for a very valuable see, just fallen vacant,
and hearing from her a price, at which it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
his, far exceeding all that he could command, persuaded
the members of his family to sell all they had
for the purpose of making this profitable investment.
The price was paid, and the bishopric was given him;
but with a fearful resemblance to the case of Ananias,
he died within the year; and his ruined family saw
the see a second time sold by the insatiable and
incorrigible Olympia. The incident only served her
as a hint always to exact cash down; and not to
content herself with a yearly payment from the accruing
revenue. The criminal judges in Rome were
directed to punish criminals of all degrees in purse
instead of person; and the fines all were paid
over with business–like exactitude to the all–powerful
favourite.</p>

<p>As Innocent became older and rapidly more infirm,
the incapability of his nephew became more and more
a source of complaint and annoyance to him. And
the young man himself seems to have been weary of
a position, which exposed him to ceaseless objurgations,
and to the contempt of all Rome. For the
escape from it, which he effected, appears to have
been of his own plotting. This was nothing less than
the resignation of his Cardinal's hat, obtaining a
release from holy orders, and marrying the recently
widowed Princess Rosano, one of the largest fortunes,
and most desirable matches in Rome. So anxious
was Innocent, it would seem, to get rid of his nephew
from the court, that he dared to conspire with him
to effect this scheme without the knowledge of Donna
Olympia. It was accomplished with all speed and
secrecy. And Camillo had to tell his mother, that
he was neither cardinal nor priest any longer, but
the husband of the beautiful and wealthy Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Rosano. Olympia's rage was extreme; the more so,
because she feared that the Princess, who was known
as a woman of much capacity, as well as of great
beauty, might not impossibly supplant her at the
Vatican. But Innocent had no thought of liberating
himself from his servitude; and was only too glad
to make amends for his share of what had been done,
and obtain peace by banishing his nephew and new
niece from Rome. As there was nothing in the
marriage with the Princess that might not have
naturally seemed to the pontiff extremely desirable
for his nephew, the Roman gossips were not a little
astonished at seeing the Pope's nephew, and the
favourite's son, an exile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"THE MARRIAGE OF THE POPE."</div>

<p>Meantime, the discontent of Rome, the remonstrances
of the Cardinals, and the contempt and
indignation of foreign courts was beginning to render
the position of Innocent and Olympia hardly tenable.
One day a large medal was conveyed into the Pope's
hands, on the obverse of which was represented
Olympia, with the pontifical tiara on her head, and
the keys in her hand: while the reverse showed
Innocent in a coif, with a spindle and distaff in his
hands. Another day a report was brought to him
from England, that a play had been represented before
Cromwell, called "The Marriage of the Pope;" in
which, Donna Olympia is represented rejecting his
addresses on account of his extreme ugliness, till,
having in vain offered her one of the keys to induce
her to consent, he attains his object at the cost of
both of them. The Emperor again had said to the
Papal Nuncio, "Your Pope, my lord, has an easy time
of it, with Madame Olympia to put him to sleep."</p>

<p>Driven by these and many other such manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
of public feeling, Innocent determined to
make a great effort. He announced to Olympia with
every expression of regret for the hard necessity,
that she must quit the Vatican; and knowing well
what he would have to endure, if he exposed himself
to her reproaches and entreaties, he forbade her to
come for the future into his presence.</p>

<p>But the weak and infirm old man had far over–calculated
his moral strength. The prop, on which
he had relied during the years of his best vigour,
could not be voluntarily relinquished now in the time
of his decrepitude. Very soon Olympia obtained
permission to make secret visits to the Vatican. These
were made generally every night; and this nightly
secret coming and going at untimely hours, threatened
to become more ridiculous, if not more seriously
scandalous, in the eyes of the lampooning Roman
world, than an acknowledged residence in the Vatican.
Besides they did not adequately meet the necessities
of the case. Olympia pointed out to the infirm old
man that her constant care and superintendence was
necessary to his personal comfort—perhaps to his
safety. So Rome very shortly saw the "papessa"
once again in her old home at the Vatican.</p>

<p>And, as from the nature of the circumstances must
necessarily have been the case, her power and entire
disposal of the functions and revenues of the papacy
was more absolute than ever.</p>

<p>But the rapidly declining health of Innocent warned
her that her time was short. And prudence might
have counselled her to make some preparation for
the storm, which she must have well known she would
have to face after his death, by moderating, if not
relinquishing the corrupt and oppressive practices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
all sorts, which were daily added in the minds of the
Romans to the long account against her. Her observation
of the world had however suggested to her a
different policy. If more danger had to be encountered,
more money would be needed to meet it.
Donna Olympia's faith in the omnipotence of money
was unbounded. Only let her have money–power
enough; and she doubted not that she should be
able to ride out the storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPE UNDER LOCK AND KEY.</div>

<p>So she applied herself with more energy and assiduity
than ever to the two objects which shared her
entire care—the collection of cash by the most unblushing
and audacious rapine and venality; and the
keeping the breath of life to the last possible instant
within the sinking frame of the old pontiff. The
latter task was so important, that both for the insuring
of proper attention, and for providing against the
danger of poison, she kept the Pope almost under
lock and key, attending to his wants with her own
hands, and allowing him to touch no food that had
not been prepared under her own eyes. During the
last year of his life, she literally hardly ever quitted
him. Once a week, we read, she left the Vatican,
secretly by night, accompanied by several porters
carrying sacks of coin, the proceeds of the week's
extortions and sales, to her own palace. And, during
these short absences, she used to lock the Pope into
his chamber, and carry the key with her!</p>

<p>It would be easy to collect from the many biographies
that have been written of Donna Olympia, a
great number of anecdotes of her frauds, simoniacal
dealings, selling of pardons, and the like. But most
of these writings have very little of the character of
historical authority. Some of them are anonymous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
and appear to be rather collections of the scandal
and gossip of the time in Rome, than authenticated
statements of facts. One there is by the well–known
Gregorio Leti, writing under the name of "the Abate
Gualdi," which has been translated into French. But
the general outline of Olympia's career is sufficiently
certain; and the various stories in question are all
to the same purpose, and contribute no additional
features to the picture.</p>

<p>At last the end was visibly at hand. During the
last ten days of his life, the Pope's mind was wholly
gone. And in these ten days, by rapidly selling off
for what she could get for them nominations to vacant
benefices and "Prelature," Olympia is said to have
amassed half a million of crowns! Her last transaction,
was with a Canon who had been some time
previously in treaty with her for a "Prelatura." He
had offered fifty, while she had stood out for eighty
thousand crowns; and the bargain had gone off. In
the last hours of Innocent's life, she sent for this
man, and told him she would take his fifty thousand.
He said he had dissipated twenty thousand of the
sum since that time, and had only thirty thousand
left. "Well!" said the unblushing dealer, "since you
can do no better, hand them over, and you shall have
the Prelatura." So the money was paid, and the
nomination obtained from the dying Pope, <i>in extremis</i>.</p>

<p>Innocent died on the 7th of January, 1655. Olympia
caused the proper notices to be given to the officials,
and immediately left the Vatican, and retired to her
own palace secretly. She had employed the two nights
previous to his death in transporting valuables thither
to a great amount.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT BAY!</div>


<p>And now came for Olympia the great crisis of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
fate. Her position was certainly a terrible one. The
instant the Pope's death was known, a storm of long
pent up hatred broke forth in execrations, accusations,
and threats, on all sides. Olympia was under no
delusion, as to her situation, and the general feeling
of Rome towards her. She knew how much and how
justly she was hated. She knew that she had been
guilty of crimes abundantly sufficient to put not only
her wealth, but her life in danger; and that a thousand
tongues were ready to bear undeniable witness
against her.</p>

<p>But Olympia was very far from giving up the game
as lost. She had enormous command of money; she
was well acquainted with the secret motives and
wishes of parties in Rome; thoroughly skilled in the
subtle underhand tactics of trading on every evil
passion, which is what is meant by policy in that
ecclesiastical world; and imbued with that profound
faith in the thorough meanness and baseness of the
highest as well as the lowest of mankind, which
people of her stamp consider to be knowledge of
the world. Though hated by the great majority of
Cardinals as well as by the people of Rome, she was
not without friends and creatures. Corrupt motives
of interest had enabled her some time previously to
Innocent's death, to make alliance with the powerful
faction of the Barberini. And thus strong in these
arms and means of defence, she sat in the privacy
of her palace—(for to have appeared in the streets
of Rome, especially during the lawless period of an
interregnum, would have been extremely dangerous)
and directed the intrigues, by means of which she
counted on escaping the consequences of the universal
indignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>Three degrees of successful issue had to be striven
for by her. The first, of which she still nourished
sanguine hopes, was that she might again appear on
the public stage influential and powerful. The second,
that the past might be buried in oblivion, and she
might be left in the quiet though obscure enjoyment
of her immense wealth. The third, that even if she
were compelled to disgorge a great part, or even the
whole of it, she might yet be safe in person.</p>

<p>All these issues, of course, depended on the election
of a new Pope. And when the disposition towards
her of the great body of the Cardinals is remembered, it
seems strange that she could have had any hope as to the
result. She contrived, however, to form an independent
party in the Conclave, which was known in Rome at
the time as "the flying squadron"—<i>squadrone volante</i>,
the avowed object of which was, to enable either of
the other contending parties to elect any pope, who
would secure Olympia's safety, and to impede the
election of an enemy. And the clever management
of this <i>squadron</i> kept the Cardinals imprisoned for
three months.</p>

<p>At length wearied out by this long confinement,
and convinced of the impossibility of electing either
of the favourite candidates of the leading parties, the
Conclave was driven in despair to the <i>pis–aller</i> of
electing one recommended only by his good character
and apparent fitness for the office. This was Fabio
Chigi of Siena, who became Pope, as Alexander the
Seventh, with the consent of the squadrone volante,
who thought that, as he had been raised to the purple
by Innocent, and was considered a moderate man, he
would not be likely to molest the "relict" of his old
patron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ALEXANDER VII.</div>

<p>Olympia was well satisfied with the result of the
election. It seems never to have occurred to her or
her friends, that the new Pope might demand a strict
account from her, merely from considerations of
abstract right and justice. She sent among the first
to compliment him on his accession; and shortly asked
for an audience. The answer was not calculated to
reassure her. Alexander sent her word that it was
not his intention to receive ladies, except on urgent
matters of business. Still determined not to give up
the game, she repeated her application to be allowed
to speak with his Holiness, with increased urgency;
but she only obtained the still more alarming reply,
that "Donna Olympia had had but too much conversation
with Popes, and that she must understand,
that things would henceforth be very different."</p>

<p>So much time elapsed, however, before any step was
taken with regard to her, that Olympia, though convinced
that all hope of further influence on public
affairs was out of the question, yet imagined that she
was to be let alone with her enormous hoards; but
Alexander, unwilling to incur the blame of acting
passionately or hastily on the subject, was listening
to the innumerable proofs of her ill–doings, and quietly
making up his mind on the matter. Meantime it was
debated by Olympia and her friends, whether her most
prudent course would be to quit Rome, to go, say,
to Loreto, on pretext of a pilgrimage; but the
heirs of the wretched woman, and especially her son
Camillo, feeling that however such a course might
secure her person, it would in all probability lead to
the confiscation of her wealth, persuaded her that
such a step was an unwise admission of guilt, and
that her case was not so hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly an order reached her to quit Rome
within three days, and to be at Orvieto within eight.
It came upon her like a thunderbolt; for she felt that
it was the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>A commissary was sent after her thither to require
a strict account from her of all the state monies that
had passed into her hands, immediate restitution of the
jewels and other valuables carried off by her from the
Vatican, and her answer to the innumerable charges
against her of selling offices, benefices, and pardons.</p>

<p>She answered by general denials, and by asserting,
that whatever money had passed through her hands
had been paid over by her to Innocent.</p>

<p>The next step, it was expected, would have been
her imprisonment. But at this stage of the business an
unexpected and terrible ally stepped in to save—not the
miserable woman herself—but at least her infamously
gotten wealth to the Pamfili family. This ally was
the pestilence, which invaded Italy, and especially
Rome, with such violence, that it threw other matters
into abeyance, by concentrating on itself all the care
and attention of Alexander and his government.</p>

<p>But the pestilence, which thus saved her moneybags,
did not spare her to the enjoyment of them;
for on its appearance in Orvieto, Olympia was one
of the first victims.</p>

<p>No further steps were taken by the government in
the matter; and Camillo Pamfili, her son, inherited
quietly the almost incredible sums she had amassed.
It was said that, besides the vast estates which she
had acquired, and an immense amount of precious
stones, and gold uncoined, more than two millions of
crowns in money were found in her coffers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPESS THE SECOND—AND LAST.</div>

<p>Such was the story of the second female Pope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
who has grasped St. Peter's keys. And if a similar
scandal has not reproduced itself in an equal degree
of intensity, it is one to which the peculiar constitution
of the Papal government and society, must be
ever especially liable.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">HER LIFE.</p>

<p class="pn p2">In the vast and magnificent church of the Dominicans
at Bologna, in the handsome chapel dedicated to
Our Lady of the Rosary, there is a modest sepulchre
belonging to the ancient Guidotti family, which attracts
as large a share of the art–loving pilgrim's notice, as
even the world–famous shrine of the founder of the
order with its statues and bas–reliefs by Niccolò di
Pisa, Afonso Lombardo, and Michael Angelo. For
there beneath the same stone were laid the bodies of
Guido Reni and Elisabetta Sirani; he full of years and
honours, at the ripe age of sixty–seven; she cut off
untimely in the morning of her working day at twenty–six.
She was no "favourite pupil" of his, as has
been written,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> for Guido died, when Sirani was four
years old; but her works are interesting to the art–student,
as far more accurate embodiments of the
traditions of his school, than the pictures of most of
those who were his immediate pupils; and her short
career is especially worthy of the notice of such as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
interested in observing female capabilities for winning
a right to a place on the roll of the world's worthies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER VOCATION.</div>

<p>The art–critics assure us that her works are stamped
with a vigour, and bold free precision of outline,
which have been rarely attained by female artists.
"It is indeed a wonderful thing," writes Lanzi,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
"that a young girl, who lived only six–and–twenty
years, should have painted the vast number of pictures
recorded by Malvasia<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>; still more so, that she should
have perfected them with a care and finish of the
highest order; and most wonderful of all, that she
should have reached this perfection in historical pieces
of large size, in a style free from that timidity, which
La Fontana, and other painters of her sex, never got
rid of."</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply citations from the best
authorities on art, to prove the high degree of excellence
in her vocation attained by this girl, at an age
when most of her competitors of the stronger sex were
climbing the first steps of the ladder. But taking this
for granted, and leaving the critical appreciation of her
works to those whose studies lead them specially in that
direction, it will be more interesting for us to endeavour
to make out for ourselves some tolerably life–like
representation of the young worker as she lived and
laboured a couple of hundred years ago in her home
at Bologna.</p>

<p>The picture ought to be, if presented aright, a singularly
pleasing one, healthy in its tone, invigorating
in its suggestions, and addressing itself vividly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
sympathies of every admirer of honest energetic labour.
Of all the types of female character and life gathered
in these volumes from various social conditions, differing
every one of them so widely from our own, this
artist figure seems to claim the closest kin to some
living phases of the life around us, and to be the most
readily and advantageously transplantable into our own
social system.</p>

<p>The story of Elisabetta Sirani's untimely death has
added a sort of melodramatic interest to her name,
which was not needed to make her life a noticeable
one. Every one who has heard her mentioned has
heard that she died by poison. Her contemporaries
suspected that she might have been poisoned; the
following generation said and wrote, that she probably
had been thus destroyed; and Lanzi, and after him
the manuals, and other common sources of information,
content themselves with simply stating that she
was poisoned, without expressing any doubt on the
subject. The reader of the following pages will see
that there is every reason to think that she died from
natural causes. The circumstances of her death, however,
and the judicial investigations to which they gave
rise, will furnish some of those little traits of the artist–family's
home and mode of life, which, far too trifling
ever to have been recorded as such by contemporaries,
are yet in every case more precious in their suggestiveness
than facts of greater importance to those who,
at a distance of a couple of centuries, seek to catch a
glimpse of any life as it passed amid its ordinary
every–day environment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FAMILY.</div>

<p>The records of the judicial proceedings to which
Elisabetta's death gave rise, were for many years sought
for in vain by various writers on subjects connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
with Bolognese art–history. The name of the person
accused of the crime was unknown. And for
want of this indication it was, it seems, impossible,
without searching the entire mass of the archives in
question, to find the required papers. At last, however,
in 1833, Signor Mazzoni Toselli had the good
fortune to light on them, and published the result of
his discovery in a small pamphlet printed at Bologna
in that year. Since that time another fortunate discovery
has brought to light the "conclusions" submitted
to the court by the advocate employed for the
prosecution, as we should say. This document was
not found in company with the records discovered by
Signor Toselli; but was put before the world by Signor
Ulisse Guidi, in a pamphlet printed at Bologna in 1854.
So that, besides obtaining from the evidence of the witnesses
examined, those little hints above alluded to of
the manner of life led in the "Casa Sirani," we have
now the means of forming a tolerably well–grounded
opinion as to the real cause of the young artist's
death.</p>

<p>The house of Giovanni Andrea Sirani in the Via
Urbana at Bologna, was the home of a family of artists.
The father was himself at the head of a considerable
school, in which Guido's second manner was the
standard of excellence aimed at, and by the master
himself and some of his scholars attained with very
respectable success. He had a son who became a
physician. But he was the only deserter from the
family profession. The three daughters, Elisabetta,
Barbara, and Anna Maria were all artists. The name
of the elder has cast that of her sisters and even of
her father, into the shade. But his works are still
well esteemed in his own city; and there are pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
by Barbara and Anna Maria Sirani in the churches of
Bologna.</p>

<p>Giovanni's wife Margherita, and his sister, who
cooked for the family, together with a female servant,
were the other members of his household. We are
told also, that Bartolommeo Zanichelli, Antonio Donzelli,
and Giulio Banzi, his pupils, lived with him upon
the footing of members of his family. The first had
"frequented his school" for fifteen years.</p>

<p>The house in the Via Urbana, which accommodated
this numerous family, and gave the seven painters, out
of the ten persons who occupied it, room to work in,
must have been a good sized one. It consisted, we
hear, of two stories, with some large rooms above "for
the school."</p>

<p>The sort of industry that prevailed in this hive
of workers may be estimated from the list of Elisabetta's
works extant in her own handwriting. Her
rapidity, it is true, was marvellous, and the sureness
of her hand was only equalled by the overflowing
abundance of her thought. We must not, therefore,
imagine that all the members of this busy art–factory
contributed to the general production in a similar
degree. Making due allowance for this, however, and
remembering that Elisabetta's works were always
highly finished, her methodical and business–like list
will give us some idea of the family produce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER WORKS.</div>

<p>In the year 1655, which is the first that figures on
her catalogue,—and she was then only seventeen,—she
painted two pictures, one for the Marchese Spada,
and one for the Municipality of Trassano. In the year
1656, five pictures. In 1657, seven pictures. In
1658, twelve pictures. In 1659, ten pictures. In 1660,
fourteen pictures. In 1661, fourteen pictures, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
one ordered by the nuns of St. Catherine contained
half figures of the size of life of the twelve Apostles.
In 1662, forty–nine pictures! Either by an error of
the pen these forty–nine works were the product of
two years' labour, which is probable, or the year 1663
from some unexplained cause, produced nothing. In
the year 1664, we find twenty–eight pictures registered.
And in the first half of 1665, the year of her death,
she had completed nine works. In the nine years and
a half, from the seventeenth to the twenty–sixth of
her age, she had thus produced a hundred and fifty
pictures,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> many of them of large size, and all of them
carefully finished! Besides this, she etched occasionally;
and many works of this class from her hand are
known to, and much sought by collectors. A record of
work honestly and conscientiously done, as Lanzi may
well say, truly wonderful!</p>

<p>Her rapidity of execution, and especially of throwing
with a sure unerring hand her first ideas upon the
canvas, was so remarkable, that to see Elisabetta paint
was considered one of the sights at Bologna most
worthy of the attention of strangers. And we find
that few personages of distinction passed through the
city without paying a visit to the artist family in the
Via Urbana.</p>

<p>"On the 13th of May, 1664," she records in the list
of works, which seems also to have served as a sort
of journal, "His Serene Highness Cosmo, crown prince
of Tuscany, came to our house to see me paint, and I
worked at a picture of the Prince Leopold his uncle in
his presence. Alluding to the three special virtues of
that great family"—(Poor Elisabetta!)—"of Justice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Charity, and Prudence, I introduced figures of them
into the picture, sketching in the infant whom Charity
is nursing, very quickly, while the prince stood by.
On leaving me, he ordered a Holy Virgin for himself,
which I executed in time for him to take with him,
when he returned to Florence. It is in an oval, with
the child in the mother's lap, who with his left hand
is caressing her, while the right, with an olive–branch
in it, rests on the world; my intention being to allude
to the peace, which, by the negotiations of his Most
Serene father, is preserved to Italy!"</p>

<p>The Duchess of Brunswick, who "came to our house
to see me paint, on the 3rd of January, 1665," was
treated, however, it would seem, with a sly bit of satire,
instead of the usual dose of flattery expected by most
personages when they condescend to stand by artists'
easels. The lady, it appears, had the reputation of
being possessed by a somewhat inordinate spirit of
self–love. So "I painted her a Cupid, a year old, looking
at himself in the glass, and wounding himself
with his own arrow." And Malvasia, the historian of
Bolognese art, who was intimate with the family,
recounts, that while painting this allegorical device,
the young artist kept repeating, "Let those comprehend
that can. I know my own meaning!"</p>

<p>It does not appear that the Duchess left any commission.</p>

<p>Then a visit from the Duca di Mirandola is mentioned;
and another from the Principe di Messerano.
And then, "all the Princes and Princesses who have
passed through Bologna this spring, have come to
look at my pictures and to see me work."</p>

<p>We find mention of commissions from the Empress
Leonora, from Prince Leopold of Tuscany, who rewards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the artist with a cross set with fifty–six diamonds,—the
most liberal recompense she had ever received;—from
the Duchess of Bavaria, who sends an order for another
picture the following year; from Cardinal Farnese;
from the Legate; and from the "Padre Inquisitore,"
who orders a Cupid crowned with laurel, with a sceptre
in his hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STYLE OF LIFE.</div>

<p>All the cash payments earned by this untiring industry,
were handed over to her father to go towards
the general maintenance of the family. But the presents
which she received in jewellery and other such
matters were considered her private property, kept in
a cupboard sacred to them, and shown by her mother
Margherita to her gossips and the friends of the family
on high days and holidays, with infinite pride and
reverence.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to suppose, that in a family of
six persons,—leaving the medical son, of whom we
find no further mention, out of the question,—in which
four of the members are bread–winners, and that by
industry so energetic, a considerable ease of circumstances
ought to have been found. And perhaps the
extreme simplicity of life, indicated by a few of the
circumstances which happen to have been recorded, is
to be attributed rather to the prevailing habits of
frugality of the time, than to poverty. Thus we find
that the master's sister occupied the position of cook
in the family. The one other servant received four
pauls, about two francs, a month for wages. And the
family dinner, of which all the members of the household
partook in company, consisted, on one occasion,—recorded
not for any special reason, but accidentally,
and therefore affording a sample of the ordinary fare,—of
toasted bread and a little fish. There is a trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
circumstance also, which may be thought to indicate
that it was not always convenient to disburse cash for
this lenten meal. For in the list of Elisabetta's
works, among the pictures executed for churches,
princes, and prelates, occurs one of "Saint Margaret,
leading a dragon with an azure ribband, painted for
the fisherman who supplies our house."</p>

<p>Her music–master also,—for Elisabetta was extremely
fond of music, and a creditable performer,—was,
we find, paid by a yearly present of a picture.</p>

<p>Possibly the father Giovanni Andrea may have been
touched with the very common Italian vice of money–loving,
and have been more niggardly in his disbursements
than he ought to have been. For we find that
now and then Elisabetta would sell some unimportant
work of hers privately, in order to supply some little
unacknowledged expenses of her mother.</p>

<p>This poor Donna Margherita, who, while her husband
and daughters were at their busy easels, had
nothing to do but to "rule her house," seems to have
been the principal cause of any little roughness which
ruffled from time to time the tranquil and cheerful
course of successful and appreciated labour in the
industrious artist home. Donna Margherita, it is to be
feared, was afflicted with a sharp tongue; and there
are very unmistakeable symptoms of poor Lucia, the
maid, not having earned her annual four–and–twenty
francs too easily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAME MARGHERITA'S TONGUE.</div>

<p>Again and again she had been on the point of throwing
up all the advantages of her position under the
provocation of her mistress's continual fault–finding.
The daily reproach, that she was not worth her keep,
was difficult to bear. Then she was accused of dressing
her hair when there was no due occasion for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
display; the immutable rule of Dame Margherita's
house being that the maid was allowed to appear with
her head dressed only when visitors of distinction were
expected to see the Signorina Elisabetta at her easel.
Then again, the unreasonable Lucia wanted to go out
occasionally,—gadding about the town, forsooth; and
in Bologna too, of all places in the world, swarming
from morn to night with idle university scholars!
Dame Margherita would have no such doings. Besides,
she wished to know what was the reason Lucia
was always so anxious to go down herself and shut the
ground–floor shutters that looked into the street, at
night. Idle enough in other matters, why was she so
anxious to perform this duty?</p>

<p>But when these provocations became more than she
could bear, and the poor girl had made up her mind
to go, Elisabetta would soothe and comfort her, with
"Come, come, Lucia, don't leave us! Take time to
think of it. Sleep on it this night, and make up your
mind in the morning!" And as Lucia, like every one
else in the house, was very fond of the Signorina
Elisabetta, she would be persuaded to think better
of it, and try to put up with Dame Margherita's
tongue.</p>

<p>But all these reproaches of seeking occasion to go
to the window at nightfall, anxiety to go out into the
town, and untimely indulgences of hair–decking, were
only grounds of suspicion, that Lucia was guilty of
the heinous offence (not even yet in these improved
times wholly extirpated from the race of Abigails)—of
possessing a lover;—which however permissible,
under proper regulations, for young persons inhabiting
drawing–rooms, is, as every respectable person knows,
most abominable in those living in kitchens. Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
there was nothing stronger against Lucia than mere
suspicion.</p>

<p>But then came one unlucky day a terrible discovery.
There passed down the Via Urbana a tinker in the
exercise of his calling. Whereupon this wicked girl,—who
could have thought there had been such deepness
in her! as Dame Margherita (we may be quite
sure) said,—bringing her mistress an old kettle out of
the cellar, asked whether it would not be well to call
in the tinker and have it mended. The tinker accordingly
was summoned, and sent under escort of this
false serving–maid to do his duty in such cellar, or outhouse,
as may have been adapted to the business in
hand. But Dame Margherita "had her suspicions;"
and despatched two of her younger children to watch
secretly the interview between Lucia and the tinker.
The result was a confirmation of the mistress's worst
fears. The first words overheard between them proved
that the tinker was an old love of Lucia's, who had
known her when in her mother's house.</p>

<p>Here was a scope for Mistress Margherita's eloquence!
When it was exhausted, the good man
Giovanni Andrea was called on to "speak as he
ought" on the occasion. And he accordingly, we are
told, "said some severe words." Even Elisabetta
laughed at poor Lucia, and asked "how she could be
so silly as to look after such a sorry knave?"</p>

<p>Now, to poor Lucia this seems to have been the last
drop in the cup; and she finally made up her mind to
leave her place. Thereupon her master, who was just
then confined to his bed by a fit of the gout, which
interrupted his work at the easel from time to time,
called her into his room and remonstrated with her.
"Don't you see, ungrateful girl that you are," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
"in what a condition you are leaving us? Here am I
unable to leave my bed. Margherita is unwell. Barbara
has the fever. And we have no one to help us."
Lucia was inflexible. "Will you not wait till we have
found another servant?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCIA TRICKED.</div>

<p>"No, Signor, I cannot!" was the provoked girl's
answer.</p>

<p>"Go, then," rejoined her angry master, "wherever
God may lead you!"</p>

<p>But Giovanni Sirani could not reconcile it to his
conscience to let the girl go forth unprotected into the
city wholly left to her own devices. And the steps he
took to prevent this are curiously illustrative of the
manners of the time. He sent for two men, who were
related to the girl; and privately arranged with them,
that they should tell her they had found her an excellent
place with a worthy family, to which they would
at once conduct her. The unsuspecting Lucia departed
accordingly; and was led by them to "the
Hospital of St. Gregory, called the Beggar's Home,"
where she was forthwith shut up a prisoner! So that
it should seem a master had the power to cause a girl
guilty of nothing but having no home, to be thus imprisoned
for her own protection: and yet that it was
necessary to use a ruse to get her there!</p>

<p>The Sirani family were a good deal surprised at
Lucia's determination to leave them just at the time
she did. For it wanted only a few days of the annual
fair held on the 24th of August. And a considerable
item in the value of her place consisted in the presents
which it was the custom to give her on this occasion.
In the first year of her service Dame Margherita had
given her a muff, and Elisabetta a couple of pauls.
The next year the mistress had given her a shift, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the Signorina a paul. And now, in the third year, she
lost her fairings by abruptly going away just before the
time when they were due.</p>

<p>This was the uncomfortable state of matters in the
Sirani family in August 1665. Elisabetta herself had
been for some time past out of her usual health.
But with her ordinary invincible industry, she stuck to
her work. With her father disabled by the gout, her
sister Barbara also down with fever, and unable to
earn anything, it was more than ever necessary that
Elisabetta should take the labouring oar. And fortunately
a fresh order for a picture from the Empress
Eleonora had recently been received. And the young
artist, answering her mother's anxious inquiries about
a pain, from which she had been suffering, by saying
that "the best way not to feel it was not to think of
it," bravely set her canvas before her, and bent her
mind to the composition of the new picture.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center mid">HER DEATH.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Elisabetta, who had been all her life previously in
the enjoyment of sound and even robust health, had
been feeling more or less unwell ever since the Lent of
that year 1665. She suffered from slight pain in the
stomach; and though she could with difficulty be got
to speak on the subject, her loss of colour and of flesh
showed unmistakeably that she was out of health.
She was nevertheless as assiduous as ever at her easel;
and in the first days of August was just setting to
work on the picture ordered, as has been said, for the
Empress Eleonora. On the 12th or 13th of that
month, the pain from which she suffered became
worse. And as Signor Gallerati, the medical man who
attended the family, called that day to see her sister
Barbara, who was ill with fever, Elisabetta spoke to
him about herself. The learned doctor told her that
no medicine could be taken for the present, as the sun
was in the sign of the Lion; that her pain was caused
by a cold; and that she might take a little syrup of
vinegar.</p>

<p>On the 24th she was able to go with her mother to
see the fair.</p>

<p>But on the 27th, as she was working in an upper
room at her picture, the pain became so violent, that
she with difficulty went down stairs to the room where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Barbara was ill in bed, and sitting down on the edge
of it, said, "Oh! sister, I have so dreadful a pain in
my stomach, that I feel as if I were dying!"</p>

<p>Barbara seeing the sudden changes in her colour,
and contortions of her features, feared that she really
was about to die; and hurriedly called their mother,
who was in the next room. The mother immediately
got her into bed; and a succession of fainting fits,
accompanied by profuse cold perspirations followed.
A messenger sent in haste to Dr. Gallerati, not finding
him at home, brought a Doctor Mattaselani, who was,
it appears, one of the leading physicians of the city.
This gentleman ordered her purgatives, and ointment
for exterior use.</p>

<p>Her mother in the meantime had given her a dose
of "Theriaca," that time–honoured Venetian medicine,
which was then celebrated all over Europe. It is
a very thick oily substance, compounded of some fifty
different ingredients, the receipt for which is said, with
much probability, to have been brought from the East
by the Venetians at a very early period. It was a
specific adapted to the then state of medical science, no
doubt. But it is a curious fact worth noticing, that
this "triaca" as the Lombards call it, is still manufactured
at Venice from the old recipe, is still prepared
by the principal—perhaps only—manufacturer
annually on the same fixed day set apart for generations
for this purpose; and quainter still, that on that
day the persons employed in the process, dress themselves
in fifteenth century costume, and thus accoutred
make their fire, bring out their cauldrons, and concoct
their medicament on one of the open "campi" of
Venice, amid a concourse of people assembled to watch
the annual ceremony. Theriaca now–a–days hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
finds its way beyond Venice and the neighbouring
parts of Lombardy. But within those limits hardly
a peasant's cottage would be found without its bottle
of the drug, in which their ancestors placed their faith
for so many generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THERIACA.</div>

<p>The Theriaca, however, as may be supposed, availed
nothing to our poor Elisabetta; and the treatment of
Dr. Mattaselani as little. The fainting–fits and cold–sweats
continued the whole night. In the morning of
the 28th came Dr. Gallerati, and ordered more purgatives,
more ointment, and the application of the diaphragm
of a sheep to the stomach! And when no
advantage was found to result from this, he gave the
patient the celebrated poison antidote "Bezoar," and
the "Olio del Granduca;"—the Grand–duke's oil;—an
antidote prepared, it should seem, in that Medicean
laboratory of poisons in the Uffizi at Florence, which
may well be believed to have been more successful in
the preparation of them than in its providing antidotes
against them.</p>

<p>When the Bezoar and the Grand–duke's oil failed to
produce any abatement in the symptoms, the parish
priest was sent for! And thus the young artist life, so
rich in promise, and in dreams of beauty yet to be
embodied, of long years of labour, and praise to be
won, was cut short in its spring.</p>

<p>Elisabetta, intent only on her art, and habituated
to a wholly objective frame of mind, had made so little
account of the symptoms of malady that had manifested
themselves during the last four or five months
of her life, that her death struck her bereaved family
as a wholly sudden and inexplicable calamity. Poison
was the first thing that occurred to them. Indeed the
idea had already presented itself to the physicians, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
is evident from the treatment. The practice of poisoning
was so common in Italy in those ages, and the
perpetration of it was rendered so little hazardous by
the prevailing ignorance of pathological anatomy, that
every death arising from causes not understood, was
immediately attributed to this crime. And as a medical
decision to that effect was a very convenient screen
for medical ignorance, the faculty were by no means
backward in encouraging and increasing the popular
suspiciousness on the subject.</p>

<p>Poor Giovanni, therefore, was readily convinced
that his daughter had died by poison; and ordered a
post–mortem examination of her body, as the first
step towards a judicial investigation. So the body
was opened by the hospital barber, the recognised
operator on such occasions, in the presence of Doctors
Gallerati and Mattaselani, and other four of the first
practitioners of Bologna.</p>

<p>Gallerati, the family medical man, who had already,
it is to be observed, treated her case as one of poisoning,
reported to the father, as the result of the examination,
that a hole was found in the lower part
of the stomach, large enough for a pea to pass, that
around the hole there was a livid circle appearing
as if burned with a hot iron, that the bowels were
much inflamed, the diaphragm corroded, and that
these appearances could only have been produced by
the action of a corrosive poison. But on Sirani
further questioning him on the nature of the poison,
he answered, that it was certainly corrosive, "but
whether administered to her, or generated naturally,
was not a matter to speak with him—the father—on,
as he had already given his opinion in the consultation
of physicians."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POISON.</div>

<p>The subject of "veleno ingenito," poison developing
itself from natural causes within the organisation,
was one much agitated in the medical world at that
time; formed an admirable occasion for the exhibition
of erudition; and was just in that state of partisan
debateability least favourable to the attainment of
truth, and most conducive to obstinate adhesion to
foregone conclusions.</p>

<p>It having been thus decided, that poor Elisabetta
had been poisoned; of course the next question that
arose was, who was the poisoner?</p>

<p>The Sirani family had no enemies, and many
friends; and the number of persons who could have
had access to her or to the food she had taken, was
very small. The members of her own family were
plunged in grief at their bereavement. The three
pupils had been sincerely attached to Elisabetta, and
were scarcely less so. There was an old woman, who,
on the day before she had been taken seriously ill,
had been employed by Giovanni to carry a picture
to a patron in the city. Fearing that the messenger
might be long detained, he had desired that she might
have some food given her in the house, before she
started on her errand. Lucia had given her some
soup from the pot preparing for the family. The old
woman said, that it was insipid. Whereupon, Lucia,
who was that same day, it will be remembered, about
to leave her place, took, as the old woman swore, a paper
of powder from her bosom, and shook some of its contents
into the soup, saying "There! take a little
cinnamon with it!" She further deposed that the
powder was reddish, but did not taste like cinnamon;
that she ate only a few spoonsful of the soup because
she felt something gritty between her teeth; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
finally, that she was afterwards taken so ill, as to be
obliged to go to the hospital. The last fact was
indubitably true; but it was equally so that she came
out cured, without it ever having occurred to the
hospital doctors to treat her for poison.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was decided, that
Lucia must be the poisoner. But she had always been
particularly fond of the deceased. Ah! but then she had
a love affair with the tinker, which looked very bad.
She had obstinately determined to leave her place
just before fairing time. That was very suspicious.
She had to all appearance poisoned the old woman
also; though nobody seems to have dreamed of asking
for what possible motive she should have committed
this second crime. Then, to clinch all, the
reverend Dr. Masi, the Archbishop's fiscal (a friend
of the Sirani family), swore, that on his visiting Lucia
in prison, in order to examine her as to the state
of her soul, she said, "If you mean to hang me, do
it at once. At all events, I have given my soul to
the devil!"</p>

<p>So that it was clear, that Lucia was the poisoner.
She was arrested, and the judicial investigations were
commenced. Two of the medical men, who had been
present at the post mortem examination, Gallerati
and another, were examined; and, after giving a
detailed account of the appearances they had observed,
declared it certain that Elisabetta had died by poison,
either administered to her or "naturally developed,"
but with strong probability in favour of the former
hypothesis.</p>

<p>But at this point of the proceeding a curious and
characteristic incident occurred. The ecclesiastical
authorities interposed a claim, that the prisoner should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
be given up to them, as having been arrested in a
place subjected to ecclesiastical immunities; which
was the case with respect to the poor–house, to which
Lucia was taken, as has been seen, when she left the
Sirani house. The claim was admitted; Lucia was
transferred to the hands of the Archbishop's officers,
and by them set at liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EXAMINATION.</div>

<p>According to the ordinary course of proceeding in
such cases, had it not been for this interposition on
the part of the Church, Lucia would have been put
to the torture, to extract from her a confession of
her guilt. And it would seem that she was saved
from this barbarity only by that fortunate interference.
But it appears, that all that had taken place in the
matter formed no bar to a new arrest, if the accused
could be caught on unprivileged ground. No further
steps however were taken in the business, till the
following April, 1666; when Lucia, who does not
appear to have made any attempt at escape, either
by flight or by remaining in sanctuary, was arrested
afresh, as she was walking in the main street of the city.</p>

<p>The first question put to her was, whether she
had any idea of the cause of her arrest. She answered
at once, "The death of La Sirani."</p>

<p>"Are you aware that any painter or other person
had any feeling of envy or hatred against the
deceased?"</p>

<p>"I neither know, nor did I ever hear of any body
hating the Signora Elisabetta, from professional
jealousy or any other cause."</p>

<p>"What was your reason for so suddenly leaving
the family a few days before the fair?"</p>

<p>"Because I was weary of hearing continual fault–finding."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you then not treated well in the Sirani
family?"</p>

<p>"By the gentlemen<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> of the family, I was always
well treated; and especially by the Signora Elisabetta.
And if it had not been for her kindness, I should
certainly have left the house long before, so insupportable
were the annoyances of the Signora Margherita.
But I remained for love of the Signora
Elisabetta, who was very fond of me."</p>

<p>She was then questioned about the tinker; although
her conduct with respect to him does not appear to
have the slightest bearing on the case. She admitted,
that he had been an old sweetheart of hers, when
she lived with her mother, and he had been a lodger
in the same house.</p>

<p>Then came the circumstance of the old woman,
and the soup, and the red powder. The woman, by
this time, quite recovered from her illness, swore
positively that Lucia had taken the powder from her
bosom, and that it was red, and that she had said
that it was cinnamon. Lucia, confronted with her,
swore that she took the powder from a box on a
shelf, that it was pepper, and she put it into the
soup in presence of Giacoma, Sirani's sister, who,
as we have seen, was the family cook.</p>

<p>Now, according to the regular practice of the criminal
courts, this contradictory swearing required
that the accused should be tortured. Moreover,
Giacoma ought to have been called as a witness.
But neither of these things was done. It seems
however, that the judge had conferred privately
with Doctor Mattaselani, and had been satisfied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
him that the old woman had never been poisoned
at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCIA'S EXILE.</div>

<p>Lucia was sent back to prison, and ordered to
produce her defence in three days. At the end of
that time an advocate presented himself on her behalf,
and showed without difficulty, as may be judged from
what has been related of the accusation, that there
was no tittle of evidence against the prisoner; and he
especially demanded that the other medical men, who
had made the post–mortem examination, should be
called to give their evidence. For two only, Gallerati,
the family doctor, and another, had hitherto been
examined.</p>

<p>This was done. And Doctor Mattaselani and another,
describing the appearance of the body exactly
as the others had done, gave it as their decided
opinion, that the death had been caused by an inflammatory
ulcer arising from natural causes; as any
medical man of the present day would, from the
symptoms detailed above, conclude to have been in
all probability the truth.</p>

<p>It having thus become tolerably clear that there
was no case whatever against Lucia Tolomelli, for that
was the unlucky girl's name, she was not condemned
as a poisoner, but banished from the Legation.</p>

<p>The Sirani family themselves, however, as well
as the judicial authorities, seem to have on reflection
come to the conclusion, that Lucia was certainly
innocent, and her exile unjust. For there is extant,
an instance, signed by Giovanni Sirani, and dated
3rd January, 1668, wherein he formally declares, that
he has no complaint to make against her, and no
opposition to offer to the remission of her sentence
of exile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>The amount of public feeling excited in Bologna
by Elisabetta Sirani's untimely death, was extraordinarily
great. As usual in similar cases, the popular
regret took the form of indignation, and demanded
an expiatory victim. As usual, also, theories more
or less melodramatic, were invented to account for
and adorn the misfortune. It was hardly to be supposed
that Lucia could have had any spite of her
own against her kind young mistress. She must
have acted then at the instigation of another; some
powerful person no doubt; some great man, whom
the young artist had offended probably, by the rejection
of amatory advances, said some, or by a
satirical use of her pencil, as others supposed. This
explained all the irregularity observed in the process.
This was why Lucia was not tortured, as by good
right she ought to have been. This made it clear why
she was set at liberty for a while, till by practising
on the doctors, they could be induced to give such
testimony as would hush the matter up, with a verdict
of death from natural causes. This also, finally,
accounted for Lucia's removal for awhile by exile,
till the excitement and curiosity of the public should
have passed.</p>

<p>And as such a theory comfortably explained much
which the citizens were at a loss to comprehend, as
it supplied abundant food for gossip, and under–breath
speculations and guesses, and wise looks, as to the
concealed author of all this wickedness, and especially
as it made a good story to tell and to write, this
became the accredited version, till now it is stated,
as a simple fact in artistic manuals and guide–books,
that Elisabetta Sirani was poisoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOCTRINE OF POISONS.</div>

<p>The real truth is, that there is not a tittle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
evidence in favour of such a supposition, to be opposed
to all the insuperable difficulties in the way of convicting
Lucia, the only person whom it was found
possible to suspect. The only fragment of foundation
to the entire fiction consists in Dr. Gallerati's ignorant
and learned trash about administered poisons, and
inborn poisons. Even he only ventured to incline in
favour of the probability of the former in this case.
And the direct testimony of Dr. Mattaselani and
one of his colleagues, agreeing as it does with the
view which any modern medical man would take of
the case as reported, viz., that the deceased died of
inflamed ulcer in the stomach, may be rightly held
to be conclusive on the subject.</p>

<p>Some letters from persons at Bologna, including
two from Giovanni Sirani, written immediately after
Elisabetta's death, to correspondents at Florence, have
recently been published in the "Rivista di Firenze."
The editor thinks that "no doubt remains at the
present day, that her (Elisabetta's) death was caused
by poison given her by the maid, Lucia Tolomelli,
the instrument either of the despised love, or of the
offended pride of some powerful personage." To the
present writer, however, the opinion expressed above,
which is also that of Signor Toselli, to whom we
are indebted for the discovery and publication of the
records of the trial, appears equally "undoubted."</p>

<p>One of the letters, six in number, is from the
physician Gallerati, in which he details the result
of the post–mortem examination as we have it in his
evidence.</p>

<p>Another is from Count Annibale Ranuzzi to the
Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, in which he says, "The
poor girl was poisoned according to the unanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
opinion of the medical men, who to the number of
seven or eight were present at the examination of the
body." This, as we have seen, was not true.</p>

<p>A third letter is from Giovanni Sirani to the same
Cardinal, in which he says that his "daughter Elisabetta
had been removed from the world by poison,
through envy."</p>

<p>A fourth letter from the same to the Cardinal, says,
that he thinks he shall be obliged "to quit his clime
of Bologna, and go where justice is not suffocated;
for this enormous crime has been concealed under
pretext of ecclesiastical immunities."</p>

<p>We knew before that such were the opinions prevalent
at Bologna at the time. But we know also
that Giovanni Sirani changed his opinion on the subject.
And it must be borne in mind, that criminal
proceedings were kept strictly secret in the Papal
States; and that the public therefore had not those
means of enlightening its judgment on the subject,
which Signor Toselli's pamphlet has supplied to us.</p>

<p>The sorrow for the young artist's untimely death
was general in Bologna, and the manifestations of it
may seem to us excessive. But in that day, when
art, though on the decline from its culminating period,
was all that retained any real life in Italy, the artist
held a place in the esteem and interest of his fellow
citizens, which, however honoured, he cannot hope
to do in communities where his art is only one of
a hundred manifestations of intellectual life and energy.
In losing her young and rising artist, Bologna lost an
important element of her claim to take rank among
her rival municipalities in the scale of civilisation and
renown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER POPULARITY.</div>

<p>Still this hardly seems to be sufficient to account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
for the outburst of wailing and enthusiastic apotheosising
which followed Elisabetta's death. Greater
artists died, were mourned, and celebrated with far
less universality of lamentation and eulogistic commemoration.
And on looking over the threnodic
expression of Bologna's regret for "La Sirani," it
seems clear that the woman had captivated the affection
of her contemporaries, as much as the artist
had excited their admiration.</p>

<p>Judging from the picture in the Ercolani gallery
at Bologna, which represents her in the act of painting
a portrait of her father, and which has been engraved
for Signor Toselli's pamphlet, she must have been
very pretty. And it is recorded that her figure was
tall and elegant. She was a good musician, and her
conversation is said to have been witty and sprightly.
Yet one of the innumerable sonnets on her death begins:</p>

<p class="pn center p1 reduct">"Fui donna in terra, e non conobbi amore."</p>
<p class="pn center p1 reduct">"A woman while on earth, I yet knew nought of love."</p>

<p class="p1">And indeed it may be supposed that she had resolutely
determined to devote herself and her life and
energies wholly and exclusively to her art. For in
Italy few marriages are made by women after the
twenty–sixth year.</p>

<p>Her funeral may be said to have been a public one,
so extensive were the absurdities of funeral pomp, and
so general the participation in the ceremony of all
classes of the citizens. Malvasia, the historian of
Bolognese art, who was intimate with her and her
family, has written what he calls her life, in his
"Felsina Pittrice," really in the tone of a man beside
himself. He is furious that Lucia was not tortured
to make her discoverer the instigator of her supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
crime; he regrets that "being a Christian and a
Priest," he cannot with propriety curse all persons
guilty of her death, as violently as he should like to
do; and altogether has written some score of pages
in a style of monstrous bombast, which seems a
caricature of the well–known absurdities of the Italian
style of that epoch.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a volume, entitled, "Il Pennello
lagrimato," published at Bologna in the year of her
death, which consists of a great variety of orations,
odes, sonnets, anagrams, funeral conundrums, and
epitaphs, in Latin and Italian, by all the literary and
learned men of the city, proving the high place poor
Elisabetta had held in the affections and esteem of
her contemporaries, and the extremity of bad taste,
puerility, and abasement, into which a century or so
of "orderly" despotism had plunged the nation.</p>

<hr class="dec2" />

<p class="pn center">(1740–1800.)</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center mid">THE APPRENTICESHIP TO THE LAUREL.</p>

<p class="pn p2">In the Via della Forca, at Florence, the eye of an
observant traveller may remark a marble slab let into
the front of an otherwise undistinguished house, and
bearing the inscription "Here lived La Corilla in the
eighteenth century." The laconic stone vouchsafes no
further word of enlightenment; those who placed it
where it stands, for the information of future generations,
having evidently imagined that nothing more
would be necessary, and that posterity, on seeing the
brief announcement, would gaze on the dirty plaster–coloured
tenement with enthusiasm, while it exclaimed,
"Ha! 'twas within these walls, then, that the bright
poet–spirit, the marvel of her age, the divine Corilla,
lived while she was in the flesh!" &amp;c., &amp;c. But
posterity unfortunately has already in the century next
after the one so illustrated begun to exclaim instead,
"Corilla lived here! And who the deuce was Corilla?"
And then posterity, it is to be feared, would think
nothing more about the matter.</p>

<p>And yet the question is worth answering. For "La
Corilla," forgotten as she is, and in nowise worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
being remembered on any other ground, was the quintessential
product and expression of the literary life of
her time and country. And, what is more important,
that literature, and those literary tastes and habits,
which may be said to have culminated in La Corilla,
were the normal product, evolved according to certain
unchanging and ascertainable laws, of the general
social system then prevailing in Italy. And this again
was with perfect regularity of cause and effect brought
about in due course of historical development; so that
from Dante, who was exiled, to La Corilla, who was
crowned at the Capitol, the march of Italy across the
centuries may be traced almost as surely in the history
of its literature, as in that of its material life and
political changes.</p>

<p>Yes. The lady who lived in the Via della Forca in
the eighteenth century was crowned at the Capitol in
Rome in the year 1776. This is the principal fact of
her story, tellable in very few words. But for the
reasons stated above, it is worth while to spend a few
minutes in examining what that crowning at the
Capitol was and meant, and how La Corilla came to
deserve that remarkable distinction.</p>

<p>We find that she had three predecessors on that
throne in the Roman Campidoglio: Petrarch, Tasso,
and "Perfetti." Petrarch and Tasso the world knows,
though it knows little of their Roman crowning. And
diligent Dryasdust researches will discover "Perfetti"
to be the name of a man—and a cavalier—who in that
same eighteenth century was similarly operated on,
and whom not even Dryasdust could have dug out from
the underlying strata, had he not been so treated.</p>

<p>And here we are struck by the remarkable fact of
the long abeyance of the laurel crown. From Tasso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
in the sixteenth, to Perfetti and Corilla in the eighteenth
century, it should seem, none were found
crownable in Italy. Are we to consider that these
recent crowned heads take rank in their country's Pantheon
next after the author of the "Gerusalemme"?
Or must it be supposed that the significance of Campidoglio
crowning became changed yet more rapidly
than the national literature, fast as it moved in the
same direction, could follow it; so that the knight
Perfetti and the lady Corilla were the first who overtook
the standard of the crown conferrers, and came
up to the modern mark?</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER UN–ARCADIC NAME.</div>

<p>Let us see whether any explanation of these puzzling
circumstances can be obtained from an examination of
La Corilla's titles to her high honour.</p>

<p>In the vulgar unpoetical world of baptismal registers,
milliners' bills, and such matter–of–fact trivialities,
"La Corilla" was known as Maria Maddalena Morelli.
It was only "in Arcadia" that she was "La Corilla
Olympica;" for such was her full Arcadian style and
title.</p>

<p>Maria Maddalena Morelli, then, in plain prose, was
born of humble parents at Pistoja, a Tuscan city some
twenty miles from Florence, in the year 1740, and was
educated in a better manner than the means of her
parents could have commanded, by the kindness of a
noble lady of that city. When she was only ten years
old, her lively gracious manners and pleasing appearance
obtained for her another and more important
patroness. This was the Princess Pallavicini, who
took the engaging child with her to Rome, and there
completed her education according to the best and
most perfect literary methods known to an age and
people, who deemed Metastasio "the Prince of Poets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>While still at Rome she began to be favourably
known to "the shepherds and shepherdesses, who
owned the gentle sway of the blond–haired god of the
silver bow," in that city for the quickness of her parts,
and inclination towards poetry. And there a third
patroness took her by the hand—the Princess Columbrano—who
carried the blossoming muse with her to
Naples, there to rhyme "amore," "a tutte le ore," for
the amusement and admiration of the polite drawing–rooms,
whose serene and illustrious inmates were unable
to perform such feats of intellect for themselves.</p>

<p>Her success in this occupation was great, and was
attended by a rapidly increasing and extending reputation.
Amid these early triumphs the youthful poetess
was wooed and won by Fernando Fernandez, a Spanish
gentleman, whose entire biography, so far as recoverable
from the greedy maw of dull oblivion, is narrated
in the above words. Having given the "Zitella"
Maddalena Morelli the social status of "La Signora
Fernandez," he retires behind the side–scene, and is no
more heard of.</p>

<p>It may be as well to state at once, however, to prevent
misconception, that, notwithstanding the social
circumstances which called Don Fernando to live in
the shade, while his wife pursued her calling in the
sunshine, there is no reason to doubt that La Signora
Fernandez was a very good wife to her husband, and
devoted herself to her domestic duties whenever she
could get out of "Arcadia" for a season.</p>

<p>As for Don Fernando, the one sole fact of his
biography will probably authorise us to conclude that
he was a shrewd gentleman, with a good eye for the
main chance; for in truth the marriage with "La
Corilla" was a very good speculation. And the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
Mr. Barnum, had he lived in those days, would assuredly
have put himself into communication with her,
and made arrangements for working the Arcadian farm
to their mutual profit. However inferior to so great
a master, Don Fernando was no doubt awake to the
Arcadian yield. And we may picture him to ourselves
as occupied in haunting the antechambers of princes
and cardinals with "programmes" in his pocket, signing
and issuing tickets, bargaining with fiddlers for
their accompaniment to the Muse's improvisation, and
doing any other such Arcadian bottle–holding as might
assist in keeping his own and the Muse's pot boiling
for the comfort of their ex–Arcadian existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAFE LITERATURE.</div>

<p>It is evident that Corilla's business was a very profitable
one. The highnesses, serenities, eminences,
and other minor grandees were condemned to dreadfully
dull lives in those days, and were delighted
with any stimulant of a sufficiently mild nature and
thoroughly safe quality. The world's rulers had long
since learned that it was good to "patronise literature."
It was in those days more than ever the fashion
to do so. But literature had of late been exhibiting
symptoms very disquieting to its courtly friends, who
found it more than ever necessary to take precautions
for having their literature of the right sort.</p>

<p>The "difficulty" between literature and princes is
one of old date; and, truth to tell, the connection
between them has rarely been creditable to either
party. If Francis I. showed his paternal regard for
learning by limiting the printing–presses in all France
to twelve licensed machines, literature, even as represented
by such men as the historian Robertson, has
been flunky enough to extol him as "the father of
letters!" How often has the clause—"but he protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
literature and loved learned men"—been
accepted in a historian's summing–up of the character
of some royal scourge of humanity, as a set–off against
a host of abominations wholly incompatible with any
real appreciation of the value of human intellect! It
is quite time that the historic claims of many princely
"fathers of literature" to the lenient consideration of
the world on this ground, should be more rightly
appreciated. And the dealings of several of the Italian
princes during the last three hundred years with those
"dangerous classes" of their subjects, the men of the
pen, form a very instructive manual of the royal art of
patronising literature.</p>

<p>Cosmo I., Duke of Florence, by the grace of
Charles V., was a most able practitioner in this line.
He founded the Florentine Academy, and regulated its
studies and duties in accordance with the great discovery,
that the exercise of men's minds on words
might be quite safe and harmless, if carefully disjoined
from any application of their thoughts to things; nay,
might even not only be harmless, but positively useful
in promoting all those qualities which make men good
subjects. And it is quite curious to observe with what
unity of aim, means, and success, the policy so inaugurated
by him has been carried out by those who came
after him. Hence the innumerable "academies" which
swarmed in every city of Italy, vieing with each other
in the absurdity of their appellations and the frivolity
of their pursuits. Hence the production of a literature
which from generation to generation grew ever
safer and safer, till it culminated in Arcadian shepherds
and shepherdesses, and gave birth to a Corilla,
who could be warranted to produce, in whatever heat
of poetical estro and fervid flow of extempore song,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
only such strains as were fitted for noble ears to hear,
and were calculated to "encourage the best sentiments
in the masses."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCADIANS.</div>

<p>The literature thus produced to meet the special
requirements of enlightened princely protectors, and
perfectionated by the dwindling intellect of successive
generations to a pitch of imbecility scarcely credible,
instructively illustrates its own birth, descent, antecedents,
and functions, by the consistent and intense
falsity which saturates and gives its character to the
entire mass of it. The exterior and avowed fictions,
which turned companies of sober middle–aged gentlemen,
nobles, magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and
divines, into Arcadian shepherds, calling each other
by such absurd <i>aliases</i> as "Parmenio Dirceo," "Prasilio
Dedaleo," "Dorillo Dafneio," and a thousand
such, were but the fitting corporeal manifestation of
a spirit as fictitious. The essence of "Arcadian"
citizenship was to think false thoughts, to speak no
word which should be a representation of any real
thing, to cut off with jealous care all possible communication
between the world of "Arcady" and the
world of reality, and to take good heed that no stray
tone of the voice of literature should by chance address
itself to any one genuine feeling of the heart
of man, evoke a sincere thought, or appeal to a real
interest. It is easy to see how admirably such a
literature was adapted to fulfil the objects of the
princely founders and patrons of "Academies."</p>

<p>Our Olympic Corilla's business therefore throve, as
every business does that produces wares in demand.
Shortly after her marriage, the now celebrated <i>Improvisatrice</i>
made a professional tour through Italy, and
was listened to with delight in the patrician saloons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
of Bologna, Modena, Parma, Venice, &amp;c. Fresh
triumphs, we are told, everywhere awaited her; and
her readiness, nimbleness of wit and tongue, and
facility, became the admiration of all Italy.</p>

<p>The land of the "dolce favella" still brings forth
"improvisatori" and "improvisatrice;" and those
who have had an opportunity of hearing performances
of the sort will readily appreciate the quality and
amount of talent needed for the production of them.
A dull, unimpressionable or unimaginative mind would
of course entirely fail at any such exercise. But it is
extremely probable, that a profound and suggestive
intellect richly laden with stores of thought, and
habitually critical in the marshalling and effective
presentment of those stores, would be found equally
unsuccessful. A light nimble wit of exclusively objective
tendency, unburdened by deep views of things,
and unimpeded by habits of examination and reflection;
a ready and copious memory, well furnished with
common–places, a good command of the language and
its inexhaustible rhyming capabilities—that mellifluous
language, of which it may be said, that every
child born to the use of it, "lisps in numbers, for the
numbers come" naturally to its attempts to talk;—and
finally, perhaps the most essential qualification of
all for the exercise of the art, a practised dexterity in
avoiding any such treatment of a given subject as
might lead to difficulty, a competent degree of skill in
keeping to generals, and in finding some thread of
connection, by virtue of which matter that can be
easily said and sung from the cut and dried assortment
of common places in store, is forced by a gentle
compulsion to serve the purpose of more or less pertinently
illustrating the topic in hand;—these are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
qualifications which form the equipment of the "improvisatore."
Practice will of course infinitely increase
the performer's capabilities. Of course, too, a clever
and bright professor of the art will string his rhymes
with more play of fancy, and a greater approach to
some novelty of poetical thought, than a stupid one.
But it is difficult to believe that anything worth even
the value of the hour spent in hearing him was ever
produced by a practitioner of improvisation. And the
habit of encouraging and admiring such performances
is doubtless, to a certain degree, pernicious to a
people who need every possible incitement to lower
their estimate of the value of words as opposed to that
of things, instead of additional temptations to accept
mere verbiage in the place of thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EUROPEAN REPUTATION.</div>

<p>But among the "distinguished circles" which patronised
our Corilla, this was exactly the article
wanted. Accordingly, when Pietro Leopoldo was to
be married to Maria Luisa of Bourbon in 1765, Corilla
was invited by the great Maria Theresa to go to Innspruck
"to celebrate the nuptials." And we can well
understand that she did so, eminently to the satisfaction
of her imperial patrons. On returning well remunerated
to Florence, she was appointed court poetess,
and received a pension. And now her reputation had
become clearly European in its extent, as far at least
as that could be conferred by the courts of Europe.
For Catherine the Second, thinking that she too would
do the royal thing in civilised style, and patronise
literature, sent an invitation to the poetess to come
from Arcady to Russia, and be court poetess there,—not,
it is to be hoped, to sing the "res gestæ" of the
sovereign! But Corilla preferred to be a ducal poetess
in "la bella Firenze," rather than an imperial one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Russia. And Catherine, though refused, nevertheless
marked her appreciation of the claims of literature by
conferring a pension on its court representative. Another
invitation came to the happy shepherdess from
Joseph the Second, who, radical reformer as he was,
yet was quite monarchical enough to admire and approve
Arcadian literature. Joseph was also refused; and
he too sent magnificent presents to the recalcitrant
Muse.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center mid">THE CORONATION.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The celebrated "improvisatrice" had been some
time before this solemnly admitted a member of their
Academy by the Arcadians of Rome. She entered
Arcady as the "pastorella, Corilla Olympica;" and
was thenceforth better known by that name than her
real one. The Arcadians were exceedingly proud of
their shepherdess; and to make the most of her, and
at the same time get an occasion of parading all their
pastoral absurdities, and obtaining each shepherd his
share of glorification, it was suggested to have a coronation
on the old Capitoline–hill, and try to make
believe for a while, that the laurel bestowed in that
time–hallowed spot, had still a value, and represented
something in the eyes of Europe.</p>

<p>There were, however, difficulties in the way, of a
nature which are not apparent in the official records
of the ceremony. These are all to be found in a
very handsomely got up volume, printed by Bodoni
the celebrated typographer, at the royal Parma press,
in the year 1779. The publication comprises also the
numerous poetical compositions produced in honour
of the occasion, together with "A list of the gentlemen
poets"—"Indice de' Signori Poeti," who took
part in the proceeding. There are no less than sixty–six
possessors of the "Os magna sonaturum!" designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
to unapprehensive posterity by such names
and titles as "Antilio Pireatide, a member of the
Inextricables of Parma, called Birdilio among the
Academicians of Concord," and, among vulgar men,
professor of rhetoric in the College at Parma;—"Aglauro
of the Reggio Hypochondriacs" (this unfortunate
person was a lady known outside Arcady as
the Countess Paradisi);—"Fidauro Tessalide, a Dominican
monk, called Lucio Lentulo among the Strong
Academicians of Rome;"—"L' Intronato, member of
the Transformed Ones of Milan;"—" Nivildo Amaranzio,
a priest, called in the outer world, Giovacchino
Pizzi, member of the Academy of Inscriptions at
Paris, a Della Cruscan at Florence, and Custos–General
of Arcadia!"—"Parmenio Dirceo of Parma, called
Philander of Crete among the shepherds of Emonia;"—"Telejo
Focidense, an Academician of Florence,
Apathist, Vice–Custos of the Alphean Colony of Arcadians,"
and among un–Arcadian men professor of
feudal law in the University of Pisa;—"Dr. Agnelli,
secretary of the Intrepid Ones, and Pro–vice–Custos
of the Ariostean Colony of Arcadians;"—and, finally,
"Maria Forster, Poetess of the late Princess of
Tuscany, Violante."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LITTLE DIFFICULTY.</div>

<p>These and a crowd of other strangely nick–named
gentlemen and ladies contribute to fill the superbly
printed pages of a book, which, it may be safely
asserted, no human eye has ever perused in its
entirety since it was printed. The Custos–General of
Arcadia himself would probably have been unequal
to the task. But the more strictly official documents
of the ceremony contained in the volume have, with
toil and much suffering from nausea, been read by the
present writer. And it is certain that no remotest hint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
of the difficulties that lay in the way of this desirable
recognition of merit, as mentioned above, is to be
discovered. The "Conservatori" of Rome, we are
told, having "specially observed the transports of
affection demonstrated by La Corilla for this favoured
city, the seat of Religion and Virtue, and hearing the
praises into which she continually broke forth in her
extemporaneous songs, of the pacific and well–regulated
government, of the greatness of mind, the invincible
justice, and rare piety of the sovereign recently
seated on the throne of St. Peter, on occasion of whose
happy exaltation she had frequently improvised, and
finally seeing her so much honoured, praised, visited,
and distinguished by many noble and conspicuous
personages,"—the Conservatori of Rome, duly rating
all these meritorious circumstances, having first presented
her with a diploma of Roman nobility, thought
fit to make application to the papal government for
permission to crown her on the Capitol. A most
gracious and benign answer was returned, forwarded
to the Custos–General of all Arcadia; and the whole
matter is made to assume the aspect of a spontaneous
homage—if not exactly to merit—at least to those
unpremeditated lays in favour of papal government,
and virtue. Pius the Sixth is touched by the enthusiastic
and ingenuous tribute of the inspired singer,
and at once falls in with the wishes of his subjects,
Arcadian and other, to award the laurel to so deserving
a shepherdess.</p>

<p>Where is there any difficulty in the matter? Is it
to be found in the shrinking modesty of the poetess?
Has any envious brother shepherd;—(for Arcadia
itself was not free from such passions);—raised an
opposing voice to the general wishes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>Not this. But that "amari aliquid," the bill.
Benignant Pius and his pacific government,—break
forth into whatever unpremeditated praises of him you
may,—will not lend his Capitoline Hill for you to be
crowned on under forty thousand dollars! A consideration
well calculated to make an aspiring poet
pause, and admirably adapted to keep the company
of laurel–crowned heads select! Where was Arcadia
to get forty thousand dollars? Forty thousand sonnets
the shepherds and shepherdesses of its tuneful vales
would have gladly advanced at a short notice. But
dollars were another matter. And without the cash
down, no crowning! The encouragement of literature,
Rome honouring herself before the world, asserting
ancient supremacy in letters and civilisation, was all
very fine; and the papal government was delighted
to encourage merit ... at forty thousand dollars a
head; would doubtless even have had the liberality
to crown a dozen for the four hundred thousand
dollars; but upon one single crowning no reduction
could be made.</p>

<p>But the Arcadian shepherds, and the gentle "pastorella"
more specially interested had a friend;—one
whose flocks were fed not in Arcady, but on wide–spreading
Tuscan pastures;—a man of money, who was
willing to invest the serious sum required in pageantry
for the eternal glorification of Arcadia,—and himself.
This public–spirited individual was the Senator
Lorenzo Ginori, who paid the cash, and was, therefore—to
leave Arcady and speak plain truth for awhile;—the
real author and getter up of the entire affair. And
the whole carefully maintained appearance of spontaneity,
the high–flown talk of the papal admiration
for the matchless poetess, and honourable encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
of letters, the floods of mutual complimentation
between all parties engaged in the grave farce, were
all as utterly false and fictitious as the "literature" to
be encouraged, the sentiments expressed, the designations
of the mummers who uttered them, and everything
else in this idyllic Arcady. And everybody
knew perfectly well, that everybody else knew that
the whole thing was a sham and a humbug. Yet they
mouthed out their speeches and their odes and sonnets,
and said all that could have been said if the thing
had been genuine, with grave decorum, without laughing
in each other's faces; and found the doing so an
exceedingly agreeable pastime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUINTESSENTIAL HUMBUG.</div>

<p>Not a hint of the real nature of the business is to be
found in the records of it, above mentioned. What
does Arcady know of dollars? Of "Phœbus the blond
ruler of Parnassus," of Arcadian shepherds in conclave,
and of the lofty meed of glorious song, we read much.
But of the Senator Lorenzo Ginori and his forty
thousand good dollars, not a word; which seems rather
hard on so munificent a patron of Arcadia.</p>

<p>The narrative of the proceedings on the occasion,
ridiculous enough even if they had been genuine,
becomes infinitely more absurd when read by the light
of the real facts of the case. It was pretended that
the Academy of Arcadians were to adjudge and decree
the crown. And they were to make believe to subject
the aspirant to a tremendously severe ordeal; on which
it was supposed their judgment was to be based. In
solemn Arcadian conclave accordingly it was arranged
that the poetess should be called on to extemporise on
twelve "subjects of science and art." And twelve
experienced shepherds are gravely appointed by the
conclave to propose themes on the following subjects:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn p1">When poor Corilla should have produced a sufficient
extempore poem on each of these subjects, she was to
be declared worthy of the laurel–crown! Sacred history
was assigned to Bishop Giovardi, who was "Dean
of Arcadia." And the Archbishop of Apamea undertook
revealed religion. Physical science was entrusted
to the Pope's physician; the other subjects confided to
equally able shepherds.</p>

<p>Three days were appointed for the solemn trial;
four poems per day being deemed as much as the poet
or the audience could endure. And on each of these,
four of the appointed twelve examiners were to hand
in a theme in a paper carefully sealed, to show that
it could not have been communicated previously to
the candidate. And of course everybody pretended
to consider this as proof perfectly conclusive on that
point.</p>

<p>The first examination was to take place at the house
of Prince Gonzago di Castiglione; and all "the cream"
of the Roman world was there.</p>

<p>"The improvisatrice," says the record, "entered the
saloon with some appearance of apprehension, seeing
herself exposed to so arduous an ordeal, and to the
judgment of the public. The signal was given to the
violins to begin their harmonious sounds for the purpose
of stirring up the poetess—<i>per iscuotere la
poetessa</i>—and while everybody was expecting some
well–considered exordium, she looked around as if lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
and stupefied; and seeing at that moment one of her
Arcadian friends enter, she burst into song imploring
of him prompt and well–timed aid. Then as if repenting
of the weakness, and disdaining all human assistance,
she invoked the mighty name of God; which
produced a tender commotion in the audience. Then
blazing up into a wonderful estro of song, the poetess,
continually changing her metre and rhythm, ran over
all the varied scientific topics proposed to her with
an inexhaustible vein of poesy."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST DAY.</div>

<p>The tournament began with pastoral poetry. And
the examiner appointed for this subject handed in a
sealed paper, which when opened in the presence of
the expectant company, was found to contain this
novel and difficult theme: "The advantages of a city
life compared with those of the country."</p>

<p>This topic having been most triumphantly disposed
of, the examiner in physical science stepped forward
and requested—by intervention of a similarly sealed
paper—that the "pastorella" would favour the company
with a poem "on the properties of light, explaining
at the same time how the images of objects are
painted in the eye."</p>

<p>The shepherdess made no more difficulty about this
than she had about the more manageable theme which
had preceded it.</p>

<p>Then came the eloquence examiner, who "invited
her to explain the nature and degree of the fatal blow
which eloquence received at the violent death of
Marcus Tullius Cicero." This, too, was successfully
despatched. And the harmony delegate next proposed
a poem on the properties of harmony, subjoining—with
a malicious significance, one might think, if it were
possible for Arcadian souls to be guilty of espièglerie—"an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
explanation why harmonious sounds, which delight
us for a while, bore us when too long continued."</p>

<p>This was explained to the perfect satisfaction of the
company. And then, the programme of that evening's
business having been thus completed, "after a short
pause for a magnificent collation, Corilla, without
manifesting the slightest sign of exhaustion," and
utterly insensible to the great truth she had been
illustrating in her fourth poem, "demanded more
themes!"</p>

<p>Whereupon an Abate among the company proposed,
"Without religion there is no true virtue." And this
thesis was handled in such style that "the audience
were carried away with inexplicable (!) admiration and
delight at hearing with what grace, learning, eloquence
and fire the above theme was treated, in the poetical
exposition of which the great improvisatrice demonstrated
how truly prodigious enthusiasm is the animating
spirit of poets."</p>

<p>On the second evening "all the magistracy of
Arcadia" was present, besides "many other illustrious
Arcadians, most ornate prelates, foreigners, distinguished
by birth or learning" (the Duke of Gloucester
was one of the former sort), "renowned monks, and
twelve virtuous Roman ladies." On this occasion the
four themes seem to have been given to the fair candidate
all together.</p>

<p>That on revealed religion was, "Of what nature and
how revealed was the first revealed religion?"</p>

<p>On sacred history: "The miraculous passage of the
Red Sea."</p>

<p>On mythology: "Why does mythology represent
Love to be blind, while at the same time it gives him
a bow and arrows to shoot a certain mark?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SECOND AND THIRD DAYS.</div>

<p>On legislation: "An European endeavouring to instruct
a savage in the advantages of legislation."</p>

<p>On these subjects "the learned poetess fully satisfied
with her sublime song the utmost expectation of
the public. She sang in various choice Tuscan metres
upon each of the enumerated topics, mixing them up
occasionally one with another;" which, considering the
nature of them, must have produced at all events some
originality of treatment, it may be supposed.</p>

<p>On this occasion, also, the inexhaustible shepherdess,
having made an end of this supply, demanded more.
Whereupon one of the twelve virtuous ladies suggested,
"The death of Pyramus and Thisbe;" and
another, "the elegant problem, Whether constancy was
most found in men or in women?"</p>

<p>"The new and spontaneous graces which Corilla
manifested in singing on these themes were truly prodigious;
and by her treatment of the first, several of
the audience"—some of the renowned monks, perhaps—"were
visibly moved to tears."</p>

<p>On the third and last evening the audience was so
great, that not only the saloon prepared for the purpose,
but the adjoining rooms were "filled with
literature and the nobility." And the following were
the subjects given.</p>

<p>On the fine arts: "Which among them is the most
useful and delightful?" "And a charming thing it
was to hear how the able improvisatrice extolled them
all, but awarded the highest place to painting."</p>

<p>In epic poetry: "A specimen of the sublime style
proper to epic poetry in the delineation of the character
of some luminous hero?" The execution of this task
was received with an outburst of applause when it
appeared that the most "luminous hero" the judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
poetess could think of was His Holiness Pope Pius
the Sixth!</p>

<p>In metaphysics she was required to set forth the
physical and moral proofs of the immortality of the
soul.</p>

<p>The remaining twelfth examination, in moral philosophy,
seems by some error or accident to have been
omitted. But the indefatigable <i>pastorella</i>, "in nowise
tired or exhausted," demanded, as on the other occasions,
fresh subjects. So the Countess Isabella Soderini
proposed to her, "The lament of a <i>pastorella</i>
abandoned by her <i>pastor</i>." And when this had been
duly sung, it was proposed to her by a bishop to conclude
her performances with "An invocation to the
gods, entreating them to be propitious on the day of
her coronation, and to come down all of them on the
Tarpeian rock to render the solemnity more enviable
and immortal." We are assured that "no language
can express the grace with which the poetess gave a
most unexpected turn to this argument," by declaring
that she needed no other gods and goddesses at her
coronation than those now around her. And the
wonderful effect produced by this "is testified by
those who had the good fortune to be present at this
last most marvellous extempore poem."</p>

<p>When it was done, the three hundred persons forming
the audience "partook of abundant refreshments.
<i>So that</i> nothing was wanting to render these literary
sessions, noble, brilliant, magnificent, and delicious."</p>

<p>A most satisfactory testimonial was of course drawn
up in due form, and signed by the examiners. It is
dated, "From the shepherd's hut (la capanna) of the
magnanimous and erudite Arcadian shepherd, Emireno
Alantino;" and was formally presented to the Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
and government as the motive and authorisation
for the coronation ceremony. This was fixed for the
31st of August. And we have next a minutely detailed
description of all the upholstery magnificences, and
the preparations for seats of various dignity; one
eminently glorious reserved for the Duke of Gloucester,
"who deigned to come in from Marino" to be
present at the ceremony; and the musicians, and the
"Magistracy of Arcadia," and that of Rome, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CORONATION.</div>

<p>The nature of the ceremony itself may be easily
imagined. The laurel crown was placed on her head
by the Conservatori of the city, as she kneeled before
them, with these words. "<i>Eximium hoc laudis poeticæ
decus, quod tuo capiti impono sub felicissimis auspiciis
sanctissimi Domini nostri Papæ Pii Sexti, Mulier
egregia et nobilis nostra Civis, sit publici non minus
erga te studii argumentum, quam obsequentissimi animi
significatio erga amplissimam illam, et plane regiam
benevolentiam, qua decoraris.</i>" To which she, still
kneeling, responded, "<i>Poetica laurus immeritæ imposita
fronti, excelsam sanctissimi Patris ac Principis Papæ
Pii Sexti munificentiam, effusamque Senatus Populique
Romani erga me voluntatem testatur, quarum utraque
aut honore dignos invenit, aut facit</i>."</p>

<p>Then of course there was cannon firing and
trumpet sounding ad libitum; and recitations not
equally ad libitum. For all Arcadia, as the record
says, would willingly have availed themselves of the
opportunity of indulging in the delight of reciting
their compositions to an audience who could not escape
from them. It was therefore absolutely necessary to
stem in some degree the threatening flood of song;
and it was determined that, besides the performances
of the <i>pastorella</i> herself, there should be permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
only one prose recitation, six sonnets, and one ode.
The latter was taken as the lion's share by the
"Custos of all Arcadia;" and the others distributed
by lot among the Arcadians.</p>

<p>The prose man abused his opportunity shamefully,
speaking sixteen octavo pages, in which he resumed
all the topics treated by Corilla in her twelve examinations,
and set forth how entirely she had satisfied
her Arcadian judges, "all of them," as he said,
"swans of an immortal wing"—"Cigni tutti d'eterne
penne!" The sonnetteers were happily restrained
by the immutable rules of their craft. But the great
Custos indulged in some couple of hundred lines of
"terza rima."</p>

<p>When all this had been got through, the <i>pastorella</i>
herself was called on to "sing the praises of mighty
Rome, and the honour of the laurel crown." And
when she had done this, it was proposed to her to
set forth "the falsity and injustice of the opinion of
those, who maintain that the Christian religion is,
by reason of its being founded in humility, not fitted
to encourage talent or foster art." Finally, she was
required to point out "the superiority of modern
philosophy to the ancient."</p>

<p>"With this last extemporaneous poem, the poetess
determined to put the seal to her glory, by running
over with wonderful rapidity all the philosophical systems
of ancient and modern times (!), and finally
awarding the pre–eminence to the present age. In
the whole course of this last song, the sensibility and
gratitude of the poetess for the honour she had received
carried her away; and in it the praises of
Rome, for the protection it accords to talent and the
fine arts, held the foremost place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAST LAUREL.</div>

<p>Then came universal congratulations from "the
princes and princesses, cavaliers, and noble foreigners,
especially the magnanimous Duke of Gloucester."</p>

<p>And so terminated the last adjudication of the laurel
crown on the hill of the Capitol; a symbol which,
once invested with true and high significance, had
dwindled in perfect sympathy with all around it, till,
like so many another superannuated embodiment of
human thought, it had become a mere trading imposture,
symbolising nothing but the utter hollowness
and intense falsity of the social system, of which it
was an unhealthy excrescence.</p>

<p class="b1">But it must not be imagined, that even in Rome
in 1776, the decorous farce with which princes, and
eminences, and Arcadian bishops, and "renowned
monks," amused themselves, was universally accepted
at more than its real worth in less polite circles outside
the official and Arcadian world. Old Pasquin
asserted his immemorial privileges on the occasion.
An immense number of satires and libels were current
in Rome, in which our poor Corilla was treated in a
way that she at least seems in no degree to have
deserved, for all that we hear of her private life,
represents her to have been a good and estimable
woman. Among other lampoons, the following is to
be found recorded by Signor Vannucci in an article
on Corilla in the "Raccolta Biographica" of Tipaldo.
It marks the popular estimate of the value of Senator
Ginori's forty–thousand scudi bargain:—</p>

<p class="ppq25">"Ordina e vuole Monsignor Missei<br />
Che se passa Corilla coll'alloro,<br />
Non le si tirin bucce o pomidoro,<br />
Sotto la pena di baiocchi sei."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Monsignor Missei was governor of Rome. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
the ordinance attributed to him by Pasquin, may be
read somewhat thus:—</p>

<p class="ppq25">"By Monsignor Missei's decree, whoever<br />
Shall pelt Corilla in her laurel crown<br />
With love–apples or parings whatsoever,<br />
Must pay the penalty of threepence down."</p>

<p class="p1">The innocent <i>pastorella</i>, however, soon withdrew
herself from the Arcadian honours and popular gibes
of the Eternal City; and carried her crown and her
reputation home to her native Tuscany. The former
she devoutly dedicated to the Virgin, over one of
whose altars, in the city of Pistoja, it may yet be
seen. The latter, as has been said, had not been
barren; but had procured for her the means of making
a comfortable home for herself and her husband in
the Via della Forca in fair Florence. She had one
child, who died in its infancy. As for her husband,
it may be remarked, that on the great day of the
coronation, among all the detail of seats set apart for
this and the other functionary and notability, we do
not meet with any mention of the smallest stool
appropriated to the Arcadian king–consort. He rises
to the surface no more, except to have his death
chronicled in 1790. His wife survived him only two
years. But she had lived long enough to see Arcadia
desolate, and the literary fashions and traditions of
her palmy day, scattered before the morning wind of
another epoch.</p>

<p class="pn center p1 large">THE LIFE OF BIANCA CAPPELLO.</p>

<hr class="dec4" />

<hr class="dec5" />

<p class="pn center p1 large">ARTICLE I.</p>

<p class="pn p2 b1">The Abate Baldassare Zamboni collected, chiefly from the
muniment–room of the Cappello family at Venice, upwards of
200 letters of Bianca, for the illustration of a life of her, which
remains unfinished in MS. Of these Signor Federico Odorici
has selected twenty–three, which he has printed in a pamphlet
entitled, "New Researches Concerning Bianca Cappello," Milan,
1858. The chivalrous object of Signor Odorici's labour is to
"rehabilitate" poor Bianca, according to the fashion so much
in vogue in these latter days. I had no opportunity of seeing
his pamphlet till my life of Bianca was finished. But I cannot
say that it has led me to alter my estimate or conception of her
character. I am indebted to him, however, for the power of
giving my reader the following letters selected from his selection
as the most interesting among them.</p>

<p class="pbq20">I.—<i>To the very magnificent Signor, Signor Andrea Cappello, my
most respected Cousin, and as it were my Brother, at
Venice.</i></p>

<p class="pn40">1572, February 21 (Venetian style).</p>

<p class="pn p1">I received and read your most welcome letter with the greatest
pleasure. I am well pleased with your prudent discourse, and if
I can judge therefrom how much you desire my return, think
how greatly I must wish to bring it to pass; and indeed I was
resolved upon it after the event<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> which has taken place, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>fortune, not content with persecuting me with unnumbered
grievances, made my father–in–law resolve on assuming the
guardianship of my daughter, and depriving me of it; and this
he has been able to do, for so the laws and statutes of this city
direct; that if the father of one defunct be yet living, to him
rather than to any other be conceded the care of his grandchildren.
Now think what must be my state of mind, and how
greatly displeased must be the most noble Signor my father and
the most magnificent Signor my brother, to whom for their better
information I have sent copies of the contracts of such guardianship
and of the laws, that they might see how matters stand with
me to my great sorrow, and that they might not again fall out
with me, who have no fault in the matter: and if it were not for
the hope that I have in the most worthy and illustrious Lady
Isabella, daughter of our Duke and my most kind patroness, I
should fear to get into some great trouble; yet I will not despair,
and will trust in our Lord God and in your illustrious excellency
for the finding of some remedy, because the world for the most
part is all out of order; and I thought I would inform you of
these particulars, because I know you have a hearty liking for
me; and I entreat you to keep me informed here of whatever may
be needful, and to defend me, if required, and to keep this our
correspondence secret as usual; and may it please you to commend
me to the Signor Doctor Gardelino, to whom for the present
I do not write, and who I know was informed of everything by
my very illustrious family, although when he was here he saw all
that happened, and was informed respecting all that was thought
likely to follow in the matter, nor will I at present say more, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From Florence, the 21st day of February, 1572.</p>

<p class="pn60">1573, January 9 (Ven. style).</p>

<p class="pn p1">... I must tell you, my Lord, that I was utterly astounded
at the answer given you by my most illustrious (<i>father</i>), for
certainly such words as those spoken by him do not agree with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
the letters which he writes me. True it is that one cannot know
the truth that is in men; yet I put my trust in God, who will do
with me as shall be best. As to what my most illustrious father
told you of me, that I wrote to him telling him that I was
mistress of thirty thousand crowns in real and chattel property,
it is true; but of this you must understand that I have to leave
some portion to my daughter as duty requires, and that she may
be honourably married as befits my daughter; and to quit this
subject that I may not trouble your Lordship further, I will
conclude, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>From Florence, the 9th day of January, 1573.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">III.—<i>To the same.</i></p>

<p class="pn60">1573, January 16.</p>

<p class="pn p1">... Your Lordship writes me that it has been said to the
most illustrious Bon<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> that I possess twenty thousand crowns in
money; but in this I think there has been some mistake, for I
never wrote that I had such a sum in money; it is very true that
I wrote to my most magnificent brother that in real and chattel
property and jewels I have more than thirty thousand crowns;
and if I should go away in favour with my most illustrious lady
dognisabella (<i>Donna Isabella Medici</i>) I should hope to take with
me the greater part of the said property and possessions; and you
must consider that I ought to leave a part of this to my daughter,
therefore I think they have exaggerated in their offers to the most
illustrious Bon, for it had been better to offer less and afterwards
increase, than to offer more and perchance not come up to the
sum, &amp;c....</p>

<p>... I have received a letter, my Lord and Brother, from the
very magnificent Francesco Moro, who writes me ... all the
conversation which you have had with my most illustrious father,
but it differs greatly from what your Lordship wrote me; because
the aforesaid Signor Francesco says that my illustrious father told
your Lordship that he would prefer me to marry here; so that
these words seem to me quite different from what you wrote me,
&amp;c., &amp;c. And I should wish, my dearest Lord and Brother, that
this business be kept as secret as possible, for if it were known to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>the most worthy and illustrious Lady Isabella it would be very
hurtful to me, and would overthrow all our plans, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Florence, the 16th day of January, 1573.</p>

<p class="pn40">Your Lordship's, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pn60"><span class="smcap">Biancha Cappello</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">I pray your Lordship to remember my birth (<i>certificate</i>) of
which I wrote to you, and send it me, whereby you will do me a
great favour.</p>


<p class="pn center p2">IV.—<i>To the same.</i></p>

<p class="pn60">1573, March 20.</p>

<p class="pn p1">I understand by your letter how that your Lordship has spoken
with my most illustrious father respecting the answer of that
gentleman from the most noble Bon, and I comprehend what that
gentleman says; nevertheless, I answer you that I trust in God's
goodness to help me by His infinite mercy, and that I put little
faith in strangers, and shall keep to the wishes of my most illustrious
father, of my Lord and Brother, and of your Magnificence;
to whom I entrust all that I possess, awaiting from you whatsoever
decision may seem to you most fitting for the satisfaction of
both parties, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pn40">Your Magnificence's, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pn60"><span class="smcap">Biancha Cappello</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">P. S. Most Magnificent Lord and Brother, I beg of you to do me
the favour to send me my Nativity, that is, the day and hour of
my birth, and let no one beside yourselves know of this thing,
&amp;c. And you will also do me a favour if you will tell me who
are they who seem to be my friends and afterwards act in contrary
fashion as you write me, that I may know against whom I
should be on my guard.</p>


<p class="pn center p2">V.—<i>To the same.</i></p>

<p class="pn60">1573, March 28.</p>

<p class="pn p1">... therefore I entreat you with my whole heart, my Lord and
Brother, to persist in this good will towards me, and to help me, for
without you I think not that things will ever come to an end, and
would to God, according to what you tell me, that my most illustrious
father had discussed this matter with you; for then it would
have had a different ending; and since by your so loving letters to
me, you have given me courage to open my heart to you respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
the discourse that your Magnificence held with Gardellino, you
did very wisely in telling him that my most illustrious father
ought to seek out some fit person for me to marry; and that
certainly in that way everything would be brought to an end,
&amp;c. And if this does not befall me, that is, if they do not think
about finding me a husband, so that the said husband may come
here for me with the most Magnificent Lord my brother, or with
your Lordship, &amp;c.... I do not think that in any other manner
I can escape from hence, &amp;c. It would be a serious matter, my
lord, and very ill–judged in me, to leave a place where I am as
much, respected and loved as if I were a queen, &amp;c....</p>

<p>Florence, the 28th day of March, 1573.</p>

<p class="pn40">Your Magnificence's, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pn60"><span class="smcap">Biancha Cappello</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">P. S. And all that I have said to you about my marrying I say
for the safety of my life, for you must know that here there is no
lack of most honourable matches and gentlemen of note who
would be glad to have me and who are urging me to it all day
long. Florentines as well as foreigners; and if I would have consented
my most illustrious lady aforesaid would have given me
awhile ago to one of her household, a Roman gentleman with an
income of four thousand crowns, a gentleman of consequence, and
distantly related to the aforesaid lady, and he never stops from
following my lady all day long that he may get me, and this I
only say to your Lordship that you may be well–advised of every
thing, and that I do not desire to go to Venice because I lack
chances of marriage here, but I only desire it in order to see my
home, and for the honour of our house, and that only, for here I
am courted and wished for, and there I should have to court and
wish for others.</p>


<p class="pn center p2">VI.—<i>To the same.</i></p>

<p class="pn60">1573, April 22.</p>

<p class="pn p1">... I was much grieved at heart by the discourse between
my most noble father and your magnificent Lordship, from which
I conclude that he is not at all well–disposed towards me, and
that his only wish to have me back at Venice is that he might
bury me in a convent, which I will by no means do, for I know
for a surety that so I should be lost, soul and body, and I do not
choose, as I have often told your lordship, to change from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
mistress to a slave; but accepting that match of which I spoke to
your lordship, I will leave everything to return to my country

stay where I am, and shall hold to your magnificent Lordship's
counsel, which I see comes from the heart; I only wish, my Lord
and Brother, that you should see that I have not failed and fail
not to do all that is possible to come home and stay with my
family; but if they will not have it I can do no more. I beseech
you ... to undertake my defence, &amp;c. ... that they may

put small faith in them, for they can speak as they will about
me, but that this talk or gossip of theirs has any truth in it
neither your Lordship nor others should believe, &amp;c.... And I
must tell your Lordship that I have a matter of great importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>

that to one who loves as you love me, no trouble seems heavy;
and I assure you, that if any one should be loved for loving, you
have good reason to love me for that I adore you: (<i>and farther
on she says</i>) as to what you tell me that I ought to obtain from
the aforesaid lady, (<i>Isabella Medici</i>) that she should write a letter
to my most noble father, I tell you, my Lord and Brother, that
this is not prudent, for I must make it appear to the said lady as
if your noble Lordship wished to remove me from hence, and not
as if I desired it myself &amp;c.; but still if the time should come
as I wrote to my brother, she (the Medici), like a wise lady, will
be silent, not choosing to seem to rob me of my good fortune,

it will be to the honour of all our house and my contentment.
I, dearest Brother, am heartily grieved that you cannot come to

would be the greatest joy I could have in the world more than
if my most noble father and magnificent brother were to come,

<p class="pn60">1573, Dec. 5.</p>

<p class="pn p1">... I have had a letter from my most magnificent brother,
who tells me, that if I do not make up my mind to go to Venice
without being married, these affairs of mine will become lengthy
and impracticable; and I tell you, my most honoured Lord and
Brother, that the lady donisabella (<i>sic</i>), will not hear of my
going from hence, except on the conditions which she wrote to
my brother, i. e. if I am married; and I swear to you, my lord,
that I have been with her for more than two days to see if I
could move her; but she told me that if I went from here
without being married, she would by no means help me; therefore,
you see, my Lord, that without her help I could do no good,
because I must leave behind my goods and my flesh, by which I
mean my daughter; and if I leave one thing still I would not
leave the other. My Lord, if you do not bestir yourself to find
or to make some friend of yours find a match for me, I think
that my business will never be concluded. (<i>At the end she adds,
that she cannot go on, because she is sent for by Isabella Medici to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
accompany her and Cardinal Fernando to a grand hunting–party
at Pisa.</i>)</p>

<p>Florence, the 5th day of December, 1573.</p>

<p class="pn60"><span class="smcap">Biancha Cappello.</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="pn center p2 large">ARTICLE II.</p>

<p class="pn p1">I am indebted also to Signor Odorici for the following important
extract from an anonymous chronicle of the life of Pope
Sixtus V., the MS. of which exists in the Quirinal library at
Rome, and which is, in his opinion, the work of a contemporary
writer.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the statements made by the annalist are
very difficult to reconcile with the theory of Ferdinando's guilt
in the matter of his brother's death.</p>

<p>The reader must balance for himself the conflicting probabilities
in this very doubtful and mysterious matter.</p>

<p>... The Nuncio therefore wrote to the Pope and Cardinal
Montalto, on the 10th of October, in the following manner:—</p>

<p>"His Highness has been ever since last Thursday, laid up with
fever at the Poggio (a country pleasance of the Grand Duke's),
an illness brought on by the fatigue of a deer hunt in which his
Highness joined on Wednesday the 6th, when the weather was
very hot. On the 7th he went with the Cardinal Archbishop
of Florence, in a carriage to Miasa, which is five miles from the
Poggio; during the journey he suffered much pain in his back.
In the afternoon, when he was wont to take some rest, he went
into the country and directed the cutting down of some trees to open
an avenue, and remained there in the sun and wind. On the 8th,
he returned to the Poggio and dined well as usual. After dinner,
he was seized with violent vomiting. In the evening, about two
hours before sundown he felt unwell, and in order to hide it he
sate down to play picquet with the Count of San Secondo; but
as his illness increased, he quitted his game, and retired to his
chamber where he took some bezoar<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> in broth, then he returned
to the company, where, about the time of the Ave Maria, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
conversed with the Grand Duchess and others, and so endured
his suffering until two hours after sunset, when he was forced to
speak of it; whereupon having summoned the physician of his
brother, the Cardinal, who was there, he felt his pulse and pronounced
him to have fever, and ordered him to go to bed; and
that night he did not sleep, and the fever increased. On Saturday
morning, the 10th, they took from him fifteen ounces of
blood, and in the evening, two hours before sunset, four ounces
more; nor did the fever at all diminish, which is considered to
be a double tertian without any very painful symptoms, except
a little dryness of the skin. It is thought, that the Grand Duke's
illness has been caused by his having eaten for several days at
his morning and evening meals, mushrooms cooked in various
ways, of which he was very fond. The illness of the Grand
Duke has much affected the Grand Duchess also, who has fever,
but not to any great degree."</p>

<p>On the 12th he writes again ... "The Grand Duke ...
on the night between Saturday and Sunday was quite easy, and
remained so till dinner time. After dinner he did business with
his secretaries. Last night he passed quietly enough, although
he has had vomitings; but these were occasioned by the medicines
given him, and were not violent."</p>

<p>He adds in cypher on another sheet, "The improvement in
the Grand Duke's state is not so great as is supposed. The blame
of this is laid on his Highness's want of obedience to the physicians,
for he insists, contrary to their orders, on having not
only snow and ice in his chamber, but he will drink everything
iced, even the syrups, and does not abstain from transacting
business to the displeasure of the two Cardinals who dare not
enter unless they are called." On Sunday the 18th, which was the
eleventh day of the Grand Duke's illness, he writes:—"He seems
better, but it is only the last flicker of the candle which is going
out. Yesterday morning, by order of the Cardinal de' Medici,
Monsignor San Giorgio, Ambassador from Mantua to Spain, was
refused an audience. The Grand Duchess is not well, but her
fever is much decreased," and in cypher, "the change for the
worse in the Grand Duke is not only an increase of fever, but
he has convulsive tremblings, which cause much alarm. The
physicians are accused of having weakened him by loss of blood
&amp;c.... At this moment I have received news that the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
Duke's Confessor was sent for in the night to the Poggio, that
he is still there this morning, and that the Duke suffered much
during confession. It is now two hours before sundown, and I
have just received news that he is <i>in extremis</i>, and has received
the most holy sacrament. So say the letters from thence, dated
two or three hours back." At nine in the morning he writes:—"The
Cardinal de' Medici is arrived, and has made known to
me through Signor Eneas Venini, his pleasure, and the death of
the Grand Duke, which took place last night, four hours and a
half after sunset. He commended his wife, children, and family,
to his brothers, referring as to other matters, to a will made by
him two years ago. The city is quite quiet, and there is no fear
of any movement." Lastly, on the 20th he writes:—"This
morning about nine o'clock, the Grand Duchess died, overcome
by the malignity of a disease which carried her off suddenly.
Not on account of her grief for the death of her husband, which
she did not know of. She died after receiving all the sacraments,
with great firmness of mind. She made her son her heir. To
her daughter she has left a certain quantity of grain, and to her
ladies five thousand crowns. This evening at dusk, the body
of the Grand Duke, in the ducal robes, was carried with 150
torches, and escorted by Florentine gentlemen, to the gate of
San Lorenzo, where it was met by the bishop and clergy."</p>

<h2 class="p4">NOTES.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center mid">NOTES TO THE LIFE OF TULLIA D'ARAGONA.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">1.—<a href="#Page_7">Page 7.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">There is in the possession of M. Eugène Piot, of Paris, who has kindly
communicated it to me, a contemporary song in celebration of the
beauty and pomp of Giulia di Ferrara. It is of extreme rarity, and is
a very curious morsel of Roman social history in the sixteenth century.
The state, glory, splendour, and social standing of the celebrated Roman
courtesan are vauntingly set forth in verses put by the writer into her
own mouth. The intention, however, is evidently satirical.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">2.—<a href="#Page_13">Page 13.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">The phraseology of the original marks the nature of Strozzi's connection
with Tullia more unmistakeably than any permissible English
translation could do. The Italian words are, "Senza qualche pratica
di donne non saprei vivere; onde ho più volentieri praticato seco, che
con altra;" &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="pn center mid">NOTES TO THE LIFE OF OLYMPIA MORATA.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">1.—<a href="#Page_39">Page 39.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">The entire passage runs as follows; "Prima era in grazia del Papa
Madonna Lucrezia sua figlia, la quale è savia e liberale; ma adesso il
Papa non l'ama tanto, e l'ha mandato a Nepi; e le ha dato Sermoneta,
che gli costa ducati ottanta mila; benche il Duca—(her brother Cesare)—ghiel'
abbia tolta, dicendo, 'è donna; non la potrà mantenere.' E si
dice anche che esso duca ecª.—(<i>sic</i>)—con la predetta sorella Lucrezia;
il qual Duca sarà, se vive, uno dei primi capitani d'Italia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>It is fair to observe, that the tenour of this ambassador's report seems
to acquit Lucrezia of having been her brother's accomplice in the
murder of her husband, Don Alphonso of Aragon.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">2.—<a href="#Page_70">Page 70.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">Olympia's biographers, M. Bonnet and Mr. Colquhoun, in a work
entitled "Life in Italy and France in the Olden Time," have supposed
that Morato was called to Ferrara by Alphonso to be tutor to his sons,
and that this engagement was previous to his exile; and the former of
the above writers names Ippolito and Alphonso as having been his
pupils. The authority he cites is a letter of Curione; in which, however,
it is simply stated that Morato educated two brothers of Hercules.
Now, of the two named by M. Bonnet, Ippolito was born in 1509, and
Alphonso in 1527, facts which alone cast some difficulty on the statement.
Further, it is difficult to understand why, when Ippolito, the
second son, and Alphonso, the fourth son, were entrusted to Morato,
Francesco, the third son, born in 1510, should have been withheld
from his care. But the question is set at rest and all made clear by the
authority of the accurate work of Girolamo Baruffaldi, in vol. viii. of
the Raccolta Ferrar. di Opusc., in which, as well as in Frizzi's elaborate
history, Morato is stated to have been entrusted with the education of
Alphonso and Alphonsino, the sons of Duke Alphonso by Laura
Dianti, who was his wife—say the Ferrarese writers—his concubine,
say the defenders of the Apostolic chamber, who considered these sons
as illegitimate—after the death of Lucrezia Borgia. Alphonso was
born in 1527, and Alphonsino in 1530. The elder would therefore
have been six, and the younger three years old at the time of Morato's
departure from Ferrara; dates which sufficiently prove that the tutorship
in question must have commenced after his return in 1539, when
the lads were respectively twelve and nine years old.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Here are Olympia's hexameters and pentameters in her own Greek:—</p>

<p class="psq20"><i>"Ούποτε μὲν ξυμπασιν ἑνὶ φρεσὶν ἢνδανε ταὐτὸ,<br />
Κ' οῦποτε πασιν ἰσον Ζεὺς παέδωκε νόον,</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">The few lines in the text on the subject of the watercourses of the
lower valley of the Po, may serve to indicate the nature of the matters
in dispute between the government of Ferrara and that of the Pope.
But they are very insufficient to give any competent idea of that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
curious and interesting subject. And any attempt to do so would lead
to a digression of most inordinate dimensions. The subject is not only
one of very curious historical interest, but is of the highest economic
and scientific importance at the present day. In one word, the
remarkably friable soil of large districts of the mountain chain of
Upper and Central Italy is in process of being moved away into the
seas on either coast of the peninsula. The large low flats, which have
been already formed by this process, make it difficult for the waters to
transport across them the materials they are heavily charged with.
Hence districts of extreme fertility, rice grounds, marshes, malaria,
rivers running in embankments above the level of the surrounding
country, inundations, malicious cutting of banks, fights, and demoralisation
of the riverain populations, old havens destroyed, and finally
deserted by the sea, commercial cities left commerceless, and a whole
train of ulterior consequences. The subject is a very large one, and to
him who would look beyond the mere temporary troubles of the Pope's
despotisms, and churches, the most vital one of any that affects the
future of Italy.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">7.—<a href="#Page_106">Page 106.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Olympia's Greek hexameters and pentameters run thus:—</p>

<p class="psq20"><i>"Κάτθανεν Ἀονίδων κυδος μέτα Παρθιενικάων<br />

<p class="pn p1 b1">Here is the original of this curious and very obscure passage:</p>

<p class="pnbq">"De vestibus, petere illas non decet. Nam nuper Princeps per
quandam mulierem nuntiavit mihi, non esse verum quod nobillissimi
Camilli uxor quicquam de salutanda filia illi dixisset. Attamen quia
filia hoc vellet, se id permettere factum; illam vero petiisse mihi unam
vestem quam non prius se daturam quam ipsa rediisset, dixit. Hæc
respondisse arbitror, ut viderem illam nihil mea causa facere, sed illius;
et ut (sed tacere melius est, quod omnes vident) Lysippæ satisfaceret
quam secum tunc fuisse credo. Ut ut hæc sint, illas me habituram vix
credo. Vale."</p>

<p class="p1">M. Jules Bonnet gives no assistance towards understanding this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
difficult passage. He translates (?) as follows, without any remark.
"Il serait feu convenable de réclamer publiquement les objets que j'ai
laissés à la cour. La duchesse m'a fait dire, par une de ses femmes,
qu'il n'était pas vrai que l'épouse du noble comte Camillo Orsini l'eût
chargée de salutations pour sa fille. Elle a cependant ajouté qu'à la
sollicitation de cette dernière, elle consentait à ce que l'on me cedât
une de mes robes, ce qui ne pourrait avoir lieu toutefois qu'après son
propre retour à Ferrare. Cette réponse a été sans doute calculée pour
me montrer qu'on agit ainsi, par consideration pour une autre, et non
pour moi; ou plutôt elle a été inspirée par la haine de celle qui ne
nous veut que du mal, et qui est en ce moment au palais. Mais il vaut
mieux se taire sur un sujet, qui n'est un secret pour personne. Je
n'espère rien obtenir quoi qu'il arrive." It will be observed that here
is no attempt at translating "quia filia hoc vellet, se id permittere
factum," seeing that by no possible construction could "hoc" refer to
the giving of the robe, or to aught else than the salutation previously
spoken of. Then why should "Lysippa" be changed into "the hatred
of one who wishes us only ill"? Is it not more likely that Lysippa,
whoever she was, merely wanted the dresses for herself?</p>


<p class="pn center p2">9.—<a href="#Page_159">Page 159.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The works of Olympia were printed under the supervision of Curione,
at Bâle, in 1570, with the following title:—</p>

<p class="pnbq">"Olympiæ Fulviæ Moratæ, fæminæ doctissimæ ac plane divinæ,
opera omnia quæ hactenus inveniri potuerunt, et quibus Cælii Secundi
Curionis selectæ epistolæ ac orationes accesserunt."</p>

<p class="p1">The work is dedicated by Curione to Queen Elizabeth. It is a
volume of small octavo size, and that part of it occupied by the writings
of Olympia consists of 244 pages.</p>

<p>The contents are as follows:—</p>

<p>Three prefaces to lectures on the Paradoxes of Cicero.</p>

<p>An essay on Q. M. Scævola in Greek.</p>

<p>Translations into Latin of two fables of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>A dialogue between Olympia and Lavinia della Rovere.</p>

<p>A dialogue between Philotima and Theophila.</p>

<p>Two books of letters. Of these forty–seven only are by Olympia.
They are all in Latin, save one in Greek, written in her girlhood to her
master Sinapi, and one in Italian. The rest of the letters are mostly
from her correspondents to her. A few are from one of these to
another on matters relating to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>After the letters there are translations of eight psalms into Greek
verse.</p>

<p>Five short pieces of a few lines of Greek verse.</p>

<p>Three equally short fragments of Latin verse.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">NOTES TO THE LIFE OF BIANCA CAPPELLO.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">1.—<a href="#Page_222">Page 222.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">The original text of the judgment leaves no doubt of Bianca's indiscretion
previous to her flight. Maria Donati is condemned, "quod
fuerit adeo perfida et temeraria, quod dum esset ancilla in domo,
v. n. d. Bartol. Capello, ausa fuerit ad instantiam Petri de Bonaventuris
filii Zanobii Florentini, ut ejus animum et libidinem expleret
lænocinium præstare in fallendo, et ad id alliciendo Blancham filiam
prdict. v. nob. ex quo ipsa Blancha non solum habuit rem cum prædicto
Petro, sed etiam cum ipso ex domo ejus patris et e venetiis
aufugit."</p>

<p class="pn center p2">2.—<a href="#Page_248">Page 248.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">The important chronicle written by Settimanni, a Florentine patrician
of the 16th century, and which contains more revelations of Medicean
secrets than perhaps any other of the numerous "ricordi" of that
period, is now at last being printed (it is said?) at Parma. Its existence,
and the important nature of its contents, have long been well known
by Florentine writers. But, for a long time, the only extant copy,
which is preserved in the "Archivio delle Riformagioni," was not permitted
to be seen.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">3.—<a href="#Page_299">Page 299.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">Galluzzi writes, that Francis consented to the wish of the ambassadors,
who desired to crown Bianca. But that this is an error, and that
the statement in the text is correct, is proved by the existence of a
letter extant in the registers of the Senate, under the date of the 6th
October, 1579, from the senate to the ambassadors Tiepolo and Michiel,
ordering them to place a ducal crown on Bianca's head, "per accondiscendere
al desiderio delle loro altezze," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Galluzzi probably thought that it <i>looked better</i> for Tuscany to represent
that Venice was the requesting, and Francesco the consenting
party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2">4.—<a href="#Page_301">Page 301.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">Few who have visited Florence will forget the strange irregularity in
the plan of the "palazzo vecchio," and the legend which was, doubtless,
told them to explain it,—that the republic would not suffer its palace
to stand in any degree on ground accursed, by having been the site
of the mansions of a vanquished faction,—dubbed, of course, when
vanquished,—enemies of their country.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">5.—<a href="#Page_335">Page 335.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">There exists a tradition among the literary men of Florence, that the
MS. of this history by Martinetti was purchased in Florence by an
Englishman, and carried to England. The loss of it is much lamented
by them, as there is reason to think that it would be found to be a
more valuable history of the period of which it treats,—the reigns of
the Medicean Grand Dukes,—than any other extant.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">6.—<a href="#Page_337">Page 337.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">I have thought it as well to give the reader the original words of
this strange passage in Signor Soderini's letter, that he may be the better
able to judge for himself how far any such meaning as that suggested,
may, with any probability, be attributed to them. They run thus:</p>

<p class="pnbq">"Quando, che alli giorni passati la Morte cavalcò sopra il suo destriero
magro, e disfatto per investirsi del titolo di Grande. La Morte
ottenne a Roma il titolo di Grande, e conseguita ch'ella ebbe cossifatta
indecentissima intitolazione, se ne cavalcava frettolosa alla volta del
Poggio a Caiano, e quivi con irresistibile forza e pari valore assaltò il
Grande Etrusco di Firenze e Siena, e lo abbattè alli 19 di Ottobre,
1587, a 4 ore e mezzo di notte, e di 47 anni lo privò di vita dopo strani
e disusati scontorcimenti, e ululati e muggiti diversi."</p>

of too great importance to be written, was her hope of being married to
the Duke after the death of the Duchess. He observes, that even the seal
attached by Bianca to this letter seems to have reference to such an idea.
It bore a Venus arming Cupid with arrows, with the motto significative
enough certainly as a device of Bianca, "<i>Aude et fiet</i>." But if such a
scheme of succeeding to the place of the Grand Duchess appeared to be of
such importance as to deserve the coming of her cousin to Florence to
discuss it, while the lady to be supplanted was still alive and well, do not
such plannings and discussions add some degree of probability to the
Florentine notion, that Giovanna's welcome death was unduly hastened?</p></div>
